	abstract = {Introduction Our objective was to evaluate the influence of rainfall regime on the population dynamics of Biomphalaria in a potential urban focus of schistosomiasis in Aracaju, Brazil, during 2009-2010. Methods Snails were collected monthly and were counted, measured and identified; the level of infection and fecal contamination at the sampling sites was determined; rainfall data were obtained. Results High levels of fecal contamination were observed, and the abundance of Biomphalaria glabrata increased during the rainy and post-rainy seasons. The snails' size was variable, and infected snails were identified independently of rainfall. Conclusions These results provide evidence of anthropogenic and climate interference in an urban focus of schistosomiasis in the Aracaju metropolitan area.},

Since 1980 a control programme has been undertaken in this  municipality. Urban and rural populations (4,719 subjects) were submitted to  faecal examinations (Kato-Katz method). The overall prevalence rate was 4.8\%  being higher in males (6.2\%) and also in the rural zone (5.8\%). The geometric  mean of S. mansoni eggs was 35.1 eggs per gramme of faeces (epg). Approximately  80.0\% of the carriers presented less than 100 epg and only 20 individuals (9.0\%)  eliminated more than half of total eggs. The highest index of potential  contamination (IPC) was in the age group of 5 to 20 years (57.6\%). Two thirds of  the investigated patients (207) were autochthonous of Pedro de Toledo. The  geographical distribution of the carriers showed a clear aggregation of the  autochthonous cases and a close association between human contact sites and  breeding places of B. tenagophila. This study shows that schistosomiasis subjects  were not randomly aggregated, the youngsters should be the main target in the  prophylaxis, and the efficacy of the control programme.},

	abstract = {Globally over 200 million people are infected with schistosomiasis, and approximately 80\% are caused by just two of five species, Schistosoma haematobium  and Schitosoma mansoni that are broadly distributed, and often overlap across  sub-Saharan Africa. Like most neglected tropical diseases, mortality is low (an  estimated 200,000 deaths annually) and morbidity is considerably high and  probably underestimated. Surprisingly, little attention has been given to  co-infection with these two species. We have studied co-infection with S. mansoni  and S. haematobium in a peri-urban community in Ghana, one of the most highly  endemic countries for schistosomiasis. We collected and examined snails of the  two intermediate host species from the reservoir adjacent to the community. We  also used microscopical examination of stool and urine samples to determine the  level of concurrent S. mansoni and S. haematobium infections in school and  administered questionnaires to assess water contact activities that predispose  pupils to infections Examination of the snail hosts revealed that 0.7\% (7/896) of  Bulinus truncatus and 1.7\% (14/780) of Biomphalaria pfeifferi snails were found  to be hosting cercariae morphologically consistent with that of S. haematobium  and S. mansoni respectively. The overall prevalence values for urogenital and  intestinal schistosomiasis were 66.8\% (135/202) and 90.1\% (163/181) respectively.  Only 50 of 181 schistosome-infected pupils had single-species infections and the  remaining 131 pupils presented concurrent infections. Among the 131 infected with  both species were 50 individuals having only S. mansoni eggs in stool and S.  haematobium eggs in urine (conventional presentation). Eighty-one children (81)  had eggs of both species in either urine and/or stool (ectopic presentation).  From these 81, 63 had eggs of both species in urine, 6 had both species in stool,  and 12 had eggs of both species present in both urine and stool. A comparatively  large number of individuals from the concurrent infected group presented high and  moderate infection intensities than the single infected groups. The  overwhelmingly high prevalence of concurrent infections indicates further study  of co-infection is needed, and points to a need call for a holistic disease  control plan so Ghana can be part of nations to achieve the WHO roadmap target  for schistosomiasis control by 2020.},

These flukes were recently reported in  some marine turtles from South America, where the occurrence of spirorchiids in  freshwater definitive and intermediate hosts is so far unknown. In the present  study, three morphotypes of brevifurcate apharyngeate distome cercariae found in  freshwater molluscs from an urban reservoir in Brazil were used for morphological  and molecular (nuclear 28S rDNA) evaluation. Two morphotypes of cercariae,  probably congeneric species, were found in 12/17,465 specimens of Biomphalaria  spp. and differ from each other by body size and sequences (0.1\%). They present  morphology similar to North American freshwater spirorchiids (Spirorchis spp.),  however surprisingly molecular data reveals that these lineages are more closely  related to marine spirorchiids. A third species found in 2/777 Pomacea sp.  differs morphologically from all previously described spirorchiid cercariae and  genetically from spirorchiids with available sequences (16-19\%), grouping in the  phylogenetic tree with freshwater North American species.

The main endemic area is the Imbo lowland, consisting  of the Rusizi plain, the urban focus of Bujumbura, and the shores of lake  Tanganyika; a small, new focus was discovered in the highlands, around lake  Cohoha. Distribution studies on 5-10\% population samples with duplicate 28 mg  Kato smears in these 4 foci showed prevalences of 33\%, 26\%, 17\%, 19\% and mean  (positive) egg loads of 110, 105, 92, 144 eggs/g, respectively. The combined  population at risk was estimated to be 400,000 people, the total number of  detectable cases 90,000. Prevalences and intensities varied greatly at the  subregional, local and even sublocal level. The age- and sex-related prevalences  and intensities of infection showed typical peaks in children and adolescents,  but remained relatively high in adults in many areas; these patterns varied from  one area to another and could be related to ecology and water contact. Morbidity  studies showed that, in children as well as in adults, schistosomiasis-related  morbidity such as (bloody) diarrhoea, hepatomealy and splenomegaly was apparent  mainly in areas with prevalences over 30-40\%. The intermediate hosts were  Biomphalaria pfeifferi (Imbo), B. sudanica (Tanganyika marshes) and B. stanleyi  (Cohoha). Population dynamic studies showed strong seasonal variations, the  patterns of which were focal and even erratic in space and time. Snail densities  and cercarial infection rates (0.85\% overall in B. pfeifferi) were low.(ABSTRACT  TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Despite the importance of these flukes, fundamental  aspects of their biology, such as intermediate hosts and larval morphology, are  poorly known. Herein, the potential involvement of aquatic mollusks in the  transmission of a species of Tanaisia is reported for the first time. METHODS:  During the search of non-emergent larval stages of trematodes in mollusks  collected from an urban waterbody from Brazil in February of 2021, 1 out of 18  specimens (5.5\%) of Biomphalaria straminea was found harboring sporocysts,  cercariae and encysted metacercariae morphologically compatible with those  described for eucotylid species. Sequences generated for 28S, ITS-2, and cox1  molecular markers were compared with sequences available in GenBank and subjected  to phylogenetic analyses. RESULTS: Molecular analyses revealed parasite  affiliation with members of the genus Tanaisia, given it groped in a strongly  supported clade with species of this genus included in the 28S phylogenetic tree.  The larvae tentatively identified as Tanaisia sp. can be conspecific with an  unpublished isolate of Tanaisia valida found in birds in South Brazil (100\%  similarity in 28S and ITS-2). CONCLUSION: Biomphalaria straminea is reported as a  natural host of a species of Tanaisia for the first time. This finding highlights  the possibility, so far unknown, of transmission of species of the family  Eucotylidae in aquatic environments.},

	issn = {0037-9085},
	abstract = {Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium affect respectively 2 million and 500,000 persons in Madagascar. Over the past decade, S. mansoni has spread in the central  Highlands of Madagascar, essentially throughout the mid-west and Antananarivo  plain. To understand this recent change in the epidemiology of S. mansoni, we  examined the relationship between its spatial distribution and several host  factors, including labour migration, urbanization and water development projects.  In the Highlands, the disease in distribution could be superimposed on the  potential expansion areas of snail distribution defined in 1958. However, the  distribution is not homogeneous, as for example the road between Betafo and  Mandoto (South West of Antananarivo). This focal pattern described in other  African countries is unique to the central Highlands of Madagascar. Rice  cultivation is the main economic activity and is associated with intense water  contact. The focal distribution may be related to an environmental adaptation of  host-parasite interaction depending on behavioural patterns, water and soil  chemistry and incompatibility between Biomphalaria pfeifferi and S. mansoni. It  is also possible that these focal patterns precede homogeneous endemicity, as  along the road Itasy-Tsiroanomandidy (west Antananarivo). Major water development  carried out in this migration area led to a rapid endemization of the disease. In  Befato-Mandoto, where soil management is more restricted, schistosomiasis due to  S. mansoni seems to have been established in some foci where epidemiologic  conditions are favourable (for example, traditional irrigation canals). In  contrast, the spread of S. mansoni in the Antananarivo plain closely follows the  settlement of an infected rural population. Epidemiologic surveys conducted on  school children in the Antananarivo suburbs, where sanitary conditions are poor,  showed a prevalence of 25\%. Human migration linked to development projects and  urbanization seems to be the principal factor associated with the spread of  schistosomiasis in the mid-west area and Antananarivo plain. In the Highlands,  the preferential exposure of adult labour migrants has contributed to the  widening of the endemic area.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although schistosomiasis is generally considered a rural phenomenon, infections have been reported within urban settings. Based on observations of  high prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni infection in schools within the informal  settlements of Kisumu City, a follow-up malacological survey incorporating 81  sites within 6 informal settlements of the City was conducted to determine the  presence of intermediate host snails and ascertain whether active transmission  was occurring within these areas. METHODS: Surveyed sites were mapped using a  geographical information system. Cercaria shedding was determined from snails and  species of snails identified based on shell morphology. Vegetation cover and  presence of algal mass at the sites was recorded, and the physico-chemical  characteristics of the water including pH and temperature were determined using a  pH meter with a glass electrode and a temperature probe. RESULTS: Out of 1,059  snails collected, 407 (38.4\%) were putatively identified as Biomphalaria  sudanica, 425 (40.1\%) as Biomphalaria pfeifferi and 227 (21.5\%) as Bulinus  globosus. The spatial distribution of snails was clustered, with few sites  accounting for most of the snails. The highest snail abundance was recorded in  Nyamasaria (543 snails) followed by Nyalenda B (313 snails). As expected, the  mean snail abundance was higher along the lakeshore (18 ± 12 snails) compared to  inland sites (dams, rivers and springs) (11 ± 32 snails) (F(1, 79) = 38.8, P {\textless}  0.0001). Overall, 19 (1.8\%) of the snails collected shed schistosome cercariae.  Interestingly, the proportion of infected Biomphalaria snails was higher in the  inland (2.7\%) compared to the lakeshore sites (0.3\%) (P = 0.0109). B. sudanica  was more abundant in sites along the lakeshore whereas B. pfeifferi and B.  globosus were more abundant in the inland sites. Biomphalaria and Bulinus snails  were found at 16 and 11 out of the 56 inland sites, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:  The high abundance of Biomphalaria and Bulinus spp. as well as observation of  field-caught snails shedding cercariae confirmed that besides Lake Victoria, the  local risk for schistosomiasis transmission exists within the informal  settlements of Kisumu City. Prospective control interventions in these areas need  to incorporate focal snail control to complement chemotherapy in reducing  transmission.},

	abstract = {A thorough knowledge of the geographic distribution of Schistosoma mansoni vector snails is indispensable for the control of Schistosoma mansoni schistosomiasis  and its epidemiologic surveillance. From the water masses of the State of São  Paulo (Brazil) 8,771 lots of snails--total of 108,244 individuals of the genus  Biomphalaria--were captured between 1982 and 2002. These specimens are now part  of the malacological collection of (Superintendência de Controle de Endemias--São  Paulo). According to species: Biomphalaria glabrata (Say, 1818), 225 lots  (6\%)--8,002 (7.4\%); specimens Biomphalaria tenagophila (d'Orbigny, 1835), 3,402  lots (91.7\%)--88,068 (81.4\%) specimens and Biomphalaria straminea (Dunker, 1848),  85 lots (2.3\%)--12,174 (11.2\%) specimens. The geographic distribution of B.  tenagophila and B. glabrata breeding sites tends to be compact and their  occupation of territory is clear-cut. B. tenagophila habitats characteristically  show a tendency to cluster around municipalities with high levels of urbanization  and organic pollution. The presence of B. straminea is isolated in all  hydrographic basins. This situation suggests that the persistence of  schistosomiasis endemic areas in the State of São Paulo depends on the chance of  host-parasite contacts resulting from the concentration of B. tenagophila and B.  glabrata breeding sites.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Social and environmental vulnerabilities contribute to the persistence and increase of Schistosomiasis, which has been a public health  problem in Brazil and worldwide. In this study, we aimed to monitor the entry,  installation, and maintenance of schistosomiasis transmission in an urban area on  the Brazilian coast over two decades (2000-2010/2010-2020). METHODS: This  population-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Porto de Galinhas, state  of Pernambuco, Brazil, to investigate the dynamics of schistosomiasis  transmission in the urban area. Through 3 malacological and parasitological  surveys and using geoprocessing technologies, schistosomiasis transmission foci  (STF), as well as cases of the disease were identified and quantified.  Statistical and geoprocessing tools were used to analyse the data. FINDINGS:  Overall, the number of STF decreased from 15 (2000) to 11 (2010) and then to 9  (2020). Although the infection ratio of snails in 2000 has decreased from 16·1\%  to 5·8\% in 2010, we observed an increase to 7·2\% in 2020. Additionally, 6,499  individuals were analysed (2012 in 2000; 2459 in 2010, and 2028 in 2020) and the  prevalence of human infection has decreased over years, from 32·5\% (2000), 16·6\%  (2010) to 8·8\% (2020). The disorderly urbanization process was directly related  to the spatial distribution of STF and schistosomiasis cases, causing a new  scenario where people became infected by walking on unpaved and flooded streets.  INTERPRETATION: Although we observed a decreasing in schistosomiasis cases and  STF, this NTD became a health problem related to urbanization in the study area.  The challenge to overcome this new sort of transmission will require a greater  understanding of the disorderly migration, spatial occupation, and degradation of  the environment.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& OBJECTIVES: : Schistosomiasis is a rural endemic disease that has been expanding to urban and coastal areas in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. The  aim of this study was to characterize the distribution of breeding sites of the  causative vector, Biomphalaria straminea in an endemic municipality for  schistosomiasis and to present the predictive models for occurrences and  dispersal of this vector snail to new areas. METHODS: : A malacological survey  was conducted during January to December 2015 in the municipality of São Lourenço  da Mata, Pernambuco, Brazil to identify the breeding sites of Biomphalaria.  Faecal contamination was determined by means of the Colitag™ diagnostic kit.  Rainfall data were collected, and correlated with snail distribution data. Kernel  density estimation, kriging and maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling were used for  spatial data analysis, by means of the spatial analysis software packages.  RESULTS: : Out of the 130 demarcated collection points, 64 were classified as  breeding sites for B. straminea. A total of 5,250 snails were collected from  these sites. Among these 64 sites, four were considered as foci of  schistosomiasis transmission and 54 as potential transmission foci. An inverse  relationship between rainfall and snail density was observed. Kernel spatial  analysis identified three areas at higher risk of snail occurrence, which were  also the areas of highest faecal contamination and included two transmission  foci. Kriging and MaxEnt modeling simulated the scenarios obtained through the  kernel analyses. INTERPRETATION \& CONCLUSION: : Use of geostatistical tools  (Kriging and MaxEnt) is efficient for identifying areas at risk and for  estimating the dispersal of Biomphalaria species across the study area.  Occurrence of B. straminea in the study area is influenced by the rainy season,  as it becomes more abundant during the period immediately after the rainy season,  increasing the risk of dispersal and the appearance of new transmission foci.},

A population-based stool survey in  1980 detected 4 asymptomatic individuals among 114 selected at random in 2 towns  and a rural community in El Seibo Province. The distribution of the transmitting  snail, Biomphalaria glabrata, considerably exceeds that of Schistosoma mansoni,  extending to the National District and capital city of Santo Domingo and well  into certain central valley provinces. There is evidence that transmission sites  have shifted during the past three decades because of urban development,  molluscicidal activities and, perhaps, introduction of competing mollusks. In  spite of intermittent control activities, the combination of domestic and  recreational use of streams with consequent fecal contamination, and the extended  distribution of B. glabrata indicates that the potential for new transmission  foci is as great today as it was 10 years ago.

Thus, the aim of this study is to present a  new epidemiological profile for the disease in a municipality with low prevalence  in the state of Alagoas, Brazil. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted  through a coproparasitological and malacological survey. A structured  questionnaire was applied to the study participants to survey possible risk  factors and a spatial analysis (kernel density) was used to measure the risk of  infection. RESULTS: Of the 347 participants, 106 (30.5\%) were infected by  Schistosoma mansoni, most of them from the urban area of the municipality (68.9\%;  73/106). A 3-fold risk of infection was found for individuals living in the urban  area and a risk of 2.15 times for self-declared farmers. Biomphalaria glabrata  and B. straminea were the species found in the municipality, but no animals were  diagnosed as infected by the parasite. Spatial analysis showed a random  distribution of vectors and human cases of the disease, and the formation of two  clusters of human cases in the urban area was seen. CONCLUSIONS: A new  epidemiological profile for schistosomiasis from S. mansoni infection was  presented in a municipality of low endemicity: a high proportion of positive  individuals in the urban area; presence of snails without positive diagnosis for  S. mansoni infection; random distribution of vectors and human cases; and absence  of association between classical risk factors and human infection.},

For that, areas of distribution of  Biomphalaria glabrata were identified and were related to environmental variables  and communities with reported schistosomiasis cases, in order to determine the  risk of infection by spatial analyses with predictive models. The research was  carried out in the municipality of Alvorada de Minas, with data obtained between  the years 2017 and 2019 inclusive. The Google Earth Engine was used to obtain  geo-climatic variables (temperature, precipitation, vegetation index and digital  elevation model), R software to determine Pearson's correlation and MaxEnt  software to obtain an ecological model. ArcGis Software was used to create maps  with data spatialization and risk maps, using buffer models (diameters: 500,  1,000 and 1,500 m) and CoKriging. Throughout the municipality, 46 collection  points were evaluated. Of these, 14 presented snails of the genus Biomphalaria.  Molecular analyses identified the presence of different species of Biomphalaria,  including B. glabrata. None of the snails eliminated S. mansoni cercariae. The  distribution of B. glabrata was more abundant in areas of natural vegetation  (forest and cerrado) and, for spatial analysis (Buffer), the main risk areas were  identified especially in the main urban area and toward the northern and eastern  extensions of the municipality. The distribution of snails correlated with  temperature and precipitation, with the latter being the main variable for the  ecological model. In addition, the integration of data from malacological  surveys, environmental characterization, fecal contamination, and data from  communities with confirmed human cases, revealed areas of potential risk for  infection in the northern and eastern regions of the municipality. In the present  study, information was integrated on epidemiological aspects, transmission and  risk areas for schistosomiasis in a small, rural municipality with low  endemicity. Such integrated methods have been proposed as important tools for the  creation of schistosomiasis transmission risk maps, serve as an example for other  communities and can be used for control actions by local health authorities,  e.g., indicate priority sectors for sanitation measures.},

The last  malacological study conducted in this urban reservoir was more than two decades  ago, and thus, an update on the distribution of the species of Biomphalaria as  well as new data on the presence of Schistosoma mansoni in this water body are  required. METHODS: The current distribution of Biomphalaria spp. in the Pampulha  reservoir and their infection with S. mansoni was evaluated during 55  malacological surveys conducted between 2009 and 2012. RESULTS: Biomphalaria  straminea displayed a high population density and distribution, and 13.7\%  (2,233/16,235) of the specimens collected were infected with larval trematodes  other than Schistosoma mansoni. Biomphalaria tenagophila and Biomphalaria  glabrata, species currently presenting a restricted distribution and small  populations, displayed trematode infection rates of 15.2\% (98/644) and 13\%  (83/640), respectively. Thirteen (2\%) specimens of B. glabrata were found to be  infected with S. mansoni. In addition, a historical review based on previous and  new data on the occurrence patterns of Biomphalaria species in this reservoir is  presented. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the Pampulha reservoir remains  a potential focus of urban schistosomiasis in Brazil, and significant changes in  the occurrence patterns of Biomphalaria species were verified.},

	abstract = {Improved knowledge of the genotypic characteristics of human rhinovirus (HRV) is required, as are nucleic detection assays with the capacity to overcome both the similarities between members of the family Picornaviridae and the wide diversity of different HRV serotypes. The goal of the present study was to investigate the variability and the genotypic diversity of clinical strains circulating in the community. Since most reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays available cannot differentiate HRV from other members of the family Picornaviridae, we also validated an assay specific for HRV detection. The 5′ noncoding regions of 87 different HRV serotypes and clinical isolates were sequenced. On the basis of sequence analysis and phylogenetic determination, we first confirmed that all clinical isolates were HRV. We then validated a real-time RT-PCR assay that was able not only to detect all HRV serotypes and all clinical isolates tested but also to accurately discriminate between rhinovirus and other viruses from the family Picornaviridae. This assay was negative with isolates of coxsackievirus (types A and B), echovirus, enterovirus, parechovirus, and poliovirus, as well as nonpicornaviruses. Among a series of bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, 4\% (7 of 161) were positive by culture, whereas 13\% (21 of 161) were positive by RT-PCR. In the present study we showed that to specifically identify HRV in clinical specimens, diagnostic assays need to overcome both the diversities and the similarities of picornaviruses. By sequencing the 5′ noncoding regions of rhinoviruses recovered from clinical specimens, we designed probes that could specifically detect rhinovirus.},

At least one virus was detected in 436 (38.3\%) specimens by FA and in 608 (53.4\%) specimens by PCR (P {\textless} 0.001). Specimen quality was inadequate for FA in 52 (4.6\%) specimens; 13 of these (25\%) were positive by PCR. In contrast, 18 (1.6\%) specimens could not be analyzed by PCR; 1 of these was positive by FA. The number of specimens positive only by PCR among specimens positive by PCR and/or FA was 18 (7.0\%) of 257 for RSV, 18 (13.4\%) of 134 for FluA, 25 (64.1\%) of 39 for PIV1, 8 (88.9\%) of 9 for PIV2, 17 (30.1\%) of 55 for PIV3, and 101 (76.5\%) of 132 for AdV. MPV was detected in 6.6\% of all specimens and in 9.5\% of the 702 specimens negative by FA. The mean number of virus copies per milliliter in specimens positive by both PCR and FA was significantly higher, at 6.7 × 107, than that in specimens positive only by PCR, at 4.1 × 104 (P {\textless} 0.001). The PCR assays were significantly more sensitive than FA assays for detecting respiratory viruses, especially parainfluenza virus and adenovirus.

	abstract = {Different viruses can be responsible for similar clinical manifestations of respiratory infections. Thus, the etiological diagnosis of respiratory viral diseases requires the detection of a large number of viruses. In this study, 6 duplex real-time PCR assays, using EvaGreen intercalating dye, were developed to detect 12 major viruses responsible for respiratory diseases: influenza A and B viruses, enteroviruses (including enterovirus spp, and rhinovirus spp), respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses group I (of which CoV 229E and CoV NL63 are part) and II (including CoV OC43 and CoV HKU1), parainfluenza viruses type 1, 2, 3 and 4, human adenoviruses and human bocaviruses. The 2 target viruses of each duplex reaction were distinguishable by the melting temperatures of their amplicons. The 6 duplex real time PCR assays were applied for diagnostic purpose on 202 respiratory samples from 157 patients. One hundred fifty-seven samples were throat swabs and 45 were bronchoalveolar lavages. The results of the duplex PCR assays were confirmed by comparison with a commercial, validated, assay; in addition, the positive results were confirmed by sequencing. The analytical sensitivity of the duplex PCR assays varied from 103 copies/ml to 104 copies/ml. For parainfluenza virus 2 only it was 105 copies/ml. Seventy clinical samples (35\%) from 55 patients (30 children and 25 adults) were positive for 1 or more viruses. In adult patients, influenza A virus was the most frequently detected respiratory virus followed by rhinoviruses. In contrast, respiratory syncytial virus was the most common virus in children, followed by enteroviruses, influenza A virus and coronavirus NL63. The small number of samples/patients does not allow us to draw any epidemiological conclusion. Altogether, the results of this study indicate that the 6 duplex PCR assays described in this study are sensitive, specific and cost-effective. Thus, this assay could be particularly useful to identify the main respiratory viruses directly from clinical samples, after nucleic acid extraction, and, also, to screen a large number of patients for epidemiological studies.},

The available methods for the rapid detection of RSV by antigen detection or PCR either lack sensitivity, require complex laboratory manipulation, or have not been evaluated in this patient population. To assess the applicability of a TaqMan-based real-time PCR technique for the detection of RSV A and B in immunocompromised adults, we developed a rapid, sensitive detection method that simultaneously detects RSV A and B and can be applied in routine diagnostics. The specificity of the assay was assessed using a panel of reference strains of other respiratory viruses and RSV. Electron microscopy-counted stocks of RSV A and B were used to develop a quantitative PCR format. Eleven copies of viral RNA could be detected for RSV A strain Long, and 14 copies could be detected for RSV B strain 9320, corresponding to 50\% tissue culture infective doses of 0.86 and 0.34, respectively. The assay was evaluated on 411 combined nose and throat swabs derived from immunocompromised adults with of without signs of respiratory tract infection. The diagnostic efficacy of the TaqMan PCR determined on the clinical samples showed that this real-time PCR technique was substantially more sensitive than the combination of conventional viral culture and shell vial culture. None of the clinical specimens derived from patients without signs of respiratory illness were found to be positive for RSV by real-time TaqMan PCR.},

	abstract = {Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonosis caused by pathogenic species of the genus Leptospira. The recent application of CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to Leptospira facilitates targeted gene silencing and provides a new tool to investigate pathogenic mechanisms of leptospirosis. CRISPRi relies on the expression of a catalytically “dead” Cas9 (dCas9) and a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). Previously, our group generated a LipL32 and a double LigA/LigB (LigAB) mutant, which, in the current study, are characterized by whole-cell proteomics in comparison with control leptospires harboring plasmid expressing dCas9 alone. Comparison of control and LigAB mutant leptospires identified 46 significantly differentially expressed (DE) proteins, including 27 proteins that were less abundant and 19 proteins that were more abundant in the LigAB mutant compared with the control. Comparison of the control and LipL32 mutant leptospires identified 243 DE proteins, of which 84 proteins were more abundant and 159 were less abundant in the LipL32 mutant strain. Significantly increased amounts of known virulence impactors and surface membrane receptors, including LipL45, LipL31, LigB, and LipL41, were identified. The virulence of LipL32 and LigAB mutants were evaluated in the hamster model of leptospirosis; the LigAB mutant was unable to cause acute disease although mutant leptospires could still be recovered from target organs, albeit at a significantly lower bacterial burden ({\textless}850 and {\textless}16-fold in liver and kidney, respectively, in comparison with control), indicating attenuation of virulence and a shift to chronic bacterial persistence. Notably, the LipL32 mutant displayed augmented virulence as evidenced by early onset of clinical symptoms and increased numbers of circulating foamy macrophages. Validation of LipL32 and LigAB mutants recovered from liver and kidney in the presence or absence of antibiotic selection revealed high plasmid stability and, by extension, gene silencing in vivo. Collectively, this work emphasizes the advantages and feasibility of using CRISPRi technology to evaluate and characterize virulence factors of leptospires and their respective host–pathogen interactions in animal models of leptospirosis. Importantly, it also provides insight into the requirements of LigA and LigB for acute disease and explores the impact of silencing expression of lipL32, which resulted in substantial changes in amounts of outer membrane proteins.},

	abstract = {Patterns of diversity in pathogen genomes provide a window into the spatiotemporal spread of disease. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that Schistosoma mansoni parasites form genetic clusters that coincide with the communities of their human hosts. We also looked for genetic clustering of parasites at the sub-community level. Our data consists of 14 microsatellite DNA markers, typed from pooled DNA samples from \$\$N=254\$\$ infected individuals living in three Brazilian communities. We found a one-to-one correspondence between genetic clusters found by K-means cluster analysis and communities when \$\$K = 3\$\$ . These clusters are also easily identified in a neighbor-joining tree and principal coordinates plots. K-means analysis with \$\$K \&gt; 3\$\$ also reveals genetic clusters of parasites at the sub-community level. These sub-clusters also appear on the neighbor-joining tree and principal coordinates plots. A surprising finding is a genetic relationship between subgroups in widely separated human communities. This connection suggests the existence of common transmission sites that have wide influence. In summary, the genetic structure of S. mansoni in Brazil juxtaposes local isolation that is occasionally broken by long-range migration. Permanent eradication of schistosomes will require both local efforts and the identification of regional infection reservoirs.},

	abstract = {Eradication or local extinction of the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni is a goal for many control programs. Population genetic analyses are helping to evaluate and guide these efforts, yet what to sample, how to sample and how densely to sample is not well established. We determined the S. mansoni allele frequency profile of nearly all infected inhabitants in two small Brazilian communities and created sub-samples representing 5–50\% of all detected human infections (infrapopulations). Samples were selected at random with replacement, and each size class was replicated 100 times. Mean pairwise differentiation for all infrapopulations (Di) and the variance effective population size (Ne) were calculated for each sample. Prior to community-wide treatment, the true mean Di was moderate (0.095–0.123) and Ne large ({\textgreater}30,000). Most samples of {\textless}50\% of those infected produced estimates outside of 5\% of the true value. For estimates within 10\%, sample sizes of {\textgreater}15\% of all infrapopulations were required. At the 3 year follow-up after treatment, the Di increased and Ne was reduced by {\textgreater}15 fold. At this time sampling of {\textgreater}30–45\% was needed to achieve the same accuracy. Following a second treatment and 4 years from baseline, the Di further increased and Ne decreased with little change in the sampling effort required. Extensive sampling is required for accurate estimates of these important population parameters. Characteristics such as population census size, infection prevalence, the community’s treatment history and the degree of infrapopulation differentiation should be taken into account. The intensity of infection was weakly correlated with the ability of a single infrapopulation to represent the component population (Dic), indicating a tendency toward random acquisition of parasite genotypes. This also suggests that targeted sampling from those most heavily infected will better represent the genetic diversity of the whole community than a random sample of infrapopulations.},

Regarding the characterized genetic variants of G. duodenalis and the immune response profiles, no differences were observed in terms of antibody reactivity or levels of serum cytokine and NO x among children infected with AI or AII subassemblages. The elevated levels of IFN-γ and NO x indicate that G. duodenalis intestinal infection in humans induces a cellular immune response detectable at the systemic level. Moreover, no significant differences in the antibody reactivity profile or the cytokine and NO x production in the sera of children infected with AI or AII G. duodenalis variants were observed, suggesting that subtypes of the parasite do not influence the immune response profile.},

However, the restriction of inflammatory and immune responses by IL-10 can also favor the development and/or persistence of chronic infections or neoplasms. Dogs that succumb to canine leishmaniasis (CanL) caused by L. infantum develop exhaustion of T lymphocytes and are unable to mount appropriate cellular immune responses to control the infection. These animals fail to mount specific lymphoproliferative responses and produce interferon gamma and TNF-alpha that would activate macrophages and promote destruction of intracellular parasites. Blocking IL-10 signaling may contribute to the treatment of CanL. In order to obtain a tool for this blockage, the present work endeavored to identify the canine casIL-10R1 amino acid sequence, generate a recombinant baculovirus chromosome encoding this molecule, which was expressed in insect cells and subsequently purified to obtain rcasIL-10R1. In addition, rcasIL-10R1 was able to bind to homologous IL-10 and block IL-10 signaling pathway, as well as to promote lymphoproliferation in dogs with leishmaniasis caused by L. infantum.},

Critérios de inclusão: diagnóstico confirmado por parasitológico de fezes para Schistosoma mansoni (método Kato-Katz). Critérios de exclusão: sorologia positiva para HIV, HTLV-1, VHB ou VHC. Foi utilizado protocolo ultrassonográfico de Niamey, proposto pela OMS. RESULTADOS: Avaliando-se isoladamente as medidas dos espaços periportais, estas se mostraram sem alterações em 21\% dos indivíduos com doença avançada da instituição terciária. Utilizando-se todos os parâmetros do protocolo, 100\% dos indivíduos da instituição terciária, com forma grave da doença, apresentaram fibrose periportal avançada. Em pacientes hepatoesplênicos da área endêmica não se identificou fibrose à ultrassonografia. CONCLUSÃO: O protocolo ultrassonográfico proposto pela OMS detecta fibrose periportal avançada nos pacientes com forma grave da doença, com maior sensibilidade do que a medida do espaço periportal isoladamente. A complexidade de identificação das fases iniciais da fibrose periportal, em áreas endêmicas, pela ultrassonografia, pode suscitar o campo da complementação diagnóstica e a continuidade do aprimoramento dos protocolos ultrassonográficos nestas áreas.},

	abstract = {OBJETIVO: Este estudo de campo objetivou identificar as alterações ultrassonográficas e hemodinâmicas indicativas da morbidade da esquistossomose mansônica em áreas endêmicas. MATERIAIS E MÉTODOS: Foram examinados pela ultrassonografia Doppler 554 pacientes esquistossomóticos em três áreas com níveis distintos de endemicidade: baixa endemicidade (n = 109); média endemicidade (n = 255) e alta endemicidade (n = 190). Para o estudo ultrassonográfico foi utilizado o protocolo da Organização Mundial da Saúde (Niamey Working Group, 2000). Pelo Doppler foram avaliados: vasos portais, artérias hepática e esplênica, veias hepáticas e vasos colaterais. RESULTADOS: Houve correlação significativa entre a frequência das alterações ultrassonográficas e o nível de endemicidade das áreas, exceto a hipertrofia do lobo esquerdo. As veias hepáticas apresentaram padrão de fluxo alterado em 23,7\% dos casos, alteração esta relacionada à presença e à intensidade de espessamento periportal. A artéria hepática não apresentou alterações nos parâmetros avaliados. Os vasos colaterais foram identificados apenas na área de alta endemicidade. A artéria esplênica apresentou alterações (aumento do calibre, da velocidade e do índice de resistência) mais frequentes na área de alta endemicidade, com diferença significativa entre os grupos. CONCLUSÃO: A ultrassonografia Doppler mostrou-se ferramenta auxiliar importante no estudo da morbidade relacionada à esquistossomose mansônica, contribuindo para definição mais precisa do perfil da doença nas áreas endêmicas.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is responsible for enterically-transmitted acute hepatitis in humans with two distinct epidemiological patterns. In endemic regions, large waterborne epidemics with thousands of people affected have been observed, and, in contrast, in non-endemic regions, sporadic cases have been described. Although contaminated water has been well documented as the source of infection in endemic regions, the modes of transmission in non-endemic regions are much less known. HEV is a single-strand, positive-sense RNA virus which is classified in the Hepeviridae family with at least four known main genotypes (1-4) of mammalian HEV and one avian HEV. HEV is unique among the known hepatitis viruses, in which it has an animal reservoir. In contrast to humans, swine and other mammalian animal species infected by HEV generally remain asymptomatic, whereas chickens infected by avian HEV may develop a disease known as Hepatitis-Splenomegaly syndrome. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 are found exclusively in humans while genotypes 3 and 4 are found both in humans and other mammals. Several lines of evidence indicate that, in some cases involving HEV genotypes 3 and 4, animal to human transmissions occur. Furthermore, individuals with direct contact with animals are at higher risk of HEV infection. Cross-species infections with HEV genotypes 3 and 4 have been demonstrated experimentally. However, not all sources of human infections have been identified thus far and in many cases, the origin of HEV infection in humans remains unknown.},

	abstract = {Background Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is endemic in EU/EEA countries, but the understanding of the burden of the infection in humans is inconsistent as the disease is not under EU surveillance but subject to national policies. Study Countries were asked to nominate experts and to complete a standardised questionnaire about the epidemiological situation and surveillance of HEV in their respective EU/EEA country. This study reviewed surveillance systems for human cases of HEV in EU/EEA countries and nominated experts assessed the epidemiology in particular examining the recent increase in the number of autochthonous cases. Results Surveillance systems and case definitions across EU/EEA countries were shown to be highly variable and testing algorithms were unreliable. Large increases of autochthonous cases were reported from Western EU/EEA countries with lower case numbers seen in Northern and Southern European countries. Lack of clinical awareness and variability in testing strategies might account for the observed differences in hepatitis E incidence across EU/EEA countries. Infections were predominantly caused by HEV genotype 3, the most prevalent virus type in the animal reservoirs. Conclusion Discussions from the expert group supported joint working across countries to better monitor the epidemiology and possible changes in risk of virus acquisition at a European level. There was agreement to share surveillance strategies and algorithms but also importantly the collation of HEV data from human and animal populations. These data collected at a European level would serve the ‘One Health’ approach to better informing on human exposure to HEV.},

However, the current treatment is only effective in 50\% of patients infected with HCV genotype 1, the most prevalent genotype in Brazil. Inhibitors of the serine protease non-structural protein 3 (NS3) have therefore been developed to improve the responses of HCV-infected patients. However, the emergence of drug-resistant variants has been the major obstacle to therapeutic success. The goal of this study was to evaluate the presence of resistance mutations and genetic polymorphisms in the NS3 genomic region of HCV from 37 patients infected with HCV genotype 1 had not been treated with protease inhibitors. Plasma viral RNA was used to amplify and sequence the HCV NS3 gene. The results indicate that the catalytic triad is conserved. A large number of substitutions were observed in codons 153, 40 and 91; the resistant variants T54A, T54S, V55A, R155K and A156T were also detected. This study shows that resistance mutations and genetic polymorphisms are present in the NS3 region of HCV in patients who have not been treated with protease inhibitors, data that are important in determining the efficiency of this new class of drugs in Brazil.},

	abstract = {Current molecular diagnostics of human pathogens provide limited information that is often not sufficient for outbreak and transmission investigation. Next generation sequencing (NGS) determines the DNA sequence of a complete bacterial genome in a single sequence run, and from these data, information on resistance and virulence, as well as information for typing is obtained, useful for outbreak investigation. The obtained genome data can be further used for the development of an outbreak-specific screening test. In this review, a general introduction to NGS is presented, including the library preparation and the major characteristics of the most common NGS platforms, such as the MiSeq (Illumina) and the Ion PGM™ (ThermoFisher). An overview of the software used for NGS data analyses used at the medical microbiology diagnostic laboratory in the University Medical Center Groningen in The Netherlands is given. Furthermore, applications of NGS in the clinical setting are described, such as outbreak management, molecular case finding, characterization and surveillance of pathogens, rapid identification of bacteria using the 16S-23S rRNA region, taxonomy, metagenomics approaches on clinical samples, and the determination of the transmission of zoonotic micro-organisms from animals to humans. Finally, we share our vision on the use of NGS in personalised microbiology in the near future, pointing out specific requirements.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may lead to significant liver injury, and viral, environmental, host, immunologic and genetic factors may contribute to the differences in the disease expression and treatment response. In the early 2000s, dual therapy using a combination of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (PR) became the standard of care for HCV treatment. In this PR era, predictive factors of therapy response related to virus and host have been identified. In 2010/2011, therapeutic regimens for HCV genotype 1 patients were modified, and the addition of NS3/4a protease inhibitors (boceprevir or telaprevir) to dual therapy increased the effectiveness and chances of sustained virologic response (SVR). Nevertheless, the first-generation triple therapy is associated with many adverse events, some of which are serious and associated with death, particularly in cirrhotic patients. This led to the need to identify viral and host predictive factors that might influence the SVR rate to triple therapy and avoid unnecessary exposure to these drugs. Over the past four years, hepatitis C treatment has been rapidly changing with the development of new therapies and other developments. Currently, with the more recent generations of pangenotipic antiviral therapies, there have been higher sustained virologic rates, and prognostic factors may not have the same importance and strength as before. Nonetheless, some variables may still be consistent with the low rates of non-response with regimens that include sofosbuvir, daclatasvir and ledipasvir. In this manuscript, we review the predictive factors of therapy response across the different treatment regimens over the last decade including the new antiviral drugs.},

The present study describes frequency distribution of different HCV genotypes and their treatment status in HCV RNA positive patients from district Swat.

The samples found untypable by the present method of genotypes was 37.8\% while, patients with mixed genotype infections were 7.6\%. More than 80\% of untypable cases were from those HCV patients who had received interferon plus ribavirin standard therapy in the past and either were non-responders and were relapsed thereafter or were under treatment. In conclusion, genotype 3a is the most prevalent HCV genotype in the region. A high prevalence rate of untypable genotypes is present in treated patients that need further investigation for the successful genotyping by developing new assays or using viral sequencing method.},

We investigated the epidemiologic characteristics of urban immigrants and natives living in a neighborhood of Salvador, Brazil where there is a focus of transmission of Schistosoma mansoni. In a cross-sectional study, all inhabitants from 3 sections of the community were interviewed and examined. In order to determine the degree of parasite differentiation between immigrants and the native born, S. mansoni eggs from stools were genotyped for 15 microsatellite markers. The area received migrants from all over the state, but most infected children had never been outside of the city, and infected snails were present at water contact sites. Other epidemiologic features suggested immigration contributed little to the presence of infection. The intensity and prevalence of infection were the same for immigrants and natives when adjusted for age, and length of immigrant residence in the community was positively associated with prevalence of infection. The population structure of the parasites also supported that the contribution from immigration was small, since the host-to-host differentiation was no greater in the urban parasite population than a rural population with little distant immigration, and there had been little differentiation in the urban population over the past 7 years. Public health efforts should focus on eliminating local transmission, and once eliminated, reintroduction from distant migration is unlikely.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To estimate the prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection in Brazil's inmate population. METHODS Systematic review on hepatitis C virus infection in the inmate population. Brazilian studies published from January 1, 1989 to February 20, 2014 were evaluated. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using a scale of 0 to 8 points. RESULTS Eleven eligible studies were analyzed and provided data on hepatitis C virus infection among 4,375 inmates from seven states of Brazil, with a mean quality classification of 7.4. The overall hepatitis C virus prevalence among Brazilian inmates was 13.6\% (ranging from 1.0\% to 41.0\%, depending on the study). The chances of inmates being seropositive for hepatitis C virus in the states of Minas Gerais (MG), Sergipe (SE), Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Goiás (GO) and Espirito Santo (ES) were 84.0\% (95\%CI 0.06;0.45), 92.0\% (95\%CI 0.04;0.13), 88.0\% (95\%CI 0.09;0.18), 74.0\% (95\%CI 0.16;0.42), 84.0\% (95\%CI 0.08;0.31) and 89.0\% (95\%CI 0.01;0.05) respectively, lower than that observed in the Sao Paulo state (seroprevalence of 29.3\%). The four studies conducted in the city of Sao Paulo revealed a lower prevalence in more recent studies compared to older ones. CONCLUSIONS The highest prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection in Brazil's inmate population was found in Sao Paulo, which may reflect the urban diversity of the country. Despite Brazilian studies having good methodological quality to evaluate the prevalence of the hepatitis C virus, they are scarce and lack data on risk factors associated with this infection, which could support decisions on prevention and implementation of public health policies for Brazilian prisons.},

	abstract = {Despite global reductions in HIV incidence and mortality, the 15 UNAIDS-designated countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA) that gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 constitute the only region where both continue to rise. HIV transmission in EECA is fuelled primarily by injection of opioids, with harsh criminalisation of drug use that has resulted in extraordinarily high levels of incarceration. Consequently, people who inject drugs, including those with HIV, hepatitis C virus, and tuberculosis, are concentrated within prisons. Evidence-based primary and secondary prevention of HIV using opioid agonist therapies such as methadone and buprenorphine is available in prisons in only a handful of EECA countries (methadone or buprenorphine in five countries and needle and syringe programmes in three countries), with none of them meeting recommended coverage levels. Similarly, antiretroviral therapy coverage, especially among people who inject drugs, is markedly under-scaled. Russia completely bans opioid agonist therapies and does not support needle and syringe programmes—with neither available in prisons—despite the country's high incarceration rate and having the largest burden of people with HIV who inject drugs in the region. Mathematical modelling for Ukraine suggests that high levels of incarceration in EECA countries facilitate HIV transmission among people who inject drugs, with 28–55\% of all new HIV infections over the next 15 years predicted to be attributable to heightened HIV transmission risk among currently or previously incarcerated people who inject drugs. Scaling up of opioid agonist therapies within prisons and maintaining treatment after release would yield the greatest HIV transmission reduction in people who inject drugs. Additional analyses also suggest that at least 6\% of all incident tuberculosis cases, and 75\% of incident tuberculosis cases in people who inject drugs are due to incarceration. Interventions that reduce incarceration itself and effectively intervene with prisoners to screen, diagnose, and treat addiction and HIV, hepatitis C virus, and tuberculosis are urgently needed to stem the multiple overlapping epidemics concentrated in prisons.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES To describe patterns of transmissible infections, chronic illnesses, socio-demographic characteristics and risk behaviors in Mexico City prisons, including in comparison to the general population, to identify those currently needing healthcare and inform policy. MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional study among 17,000 prisoners at 4 Mexico City prisons (June to December 2010). Participation was voluntary, confidential and based on informed consent. Participants were tested for HIV, Hepatitis B \& C, syphilis, hypertension, obesity, and, if at risk, glucose and cholesterol. A subset completed a questionnaire on socio-demographic characteristics and risk behaviors. Positive results were delivered with counseling and treatment or referral. RESULTS 76.8\% (15,517/20,196) of men and 92.9\% (1,779/1,914) of women participated. Complete data sets were available for 98.8\%. The following prevalence data were established for transmissible infections: HIV 0.7\%; syphilis: Anti-TP+/VDRL+ 2.0\%; Hepatitis B: HBcAb 2.8\%, HBsAg 0.15\%; Anti-HCV 3.2\%. Obesity: 9.5\% men, 33.8\% women. Compared with national age- and sex-matched data, the relative prevalence was greater for HIV and syphilis among women, HIV and Hepatitis C in men, and all infections in younger participants. Obesity prevalence was similar for women and lower among male participants. The prevalence of previously diagnosed diabetes and hypertension was lower. Questionnaire data (1,934 men, 520 women) demonstrated lower educational levels, increased smoking and substance use compared to national data. High levels of non-sterile tattooing, physical abuse and histories of sexual violence were found. CONCLUSION The study identified that health screening is acceptable to Mexico City prisoners and feasible on a large-scale. It demonstrated higher prevalence of HIV and other infections compared to national data, though low rates compared to international data. Individual participants benefited from earlier diagnosis, treatment and support. The data collected will also enable the formulation of improved policy for this vulnerable group.},

	abstract = {In a 4-year follow-up study, patients with acute sporadic non-A, non-B (NANB) hepatitis were evaluated to determine the etiology and natural history of the disease. Acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) was detected in 13 of 43 (30\%) of patients, anti-hepatitis E virus (HEV) IgG in 5 (12\%), and 25 (58\%) were considered non-A-E. The HCV RNA was detected in all HCV patients but none of the non-A-E cases. The initial clinical and biochemical presentation of the HCV and non-A-E cases was quite similar, although 2 of the non-A-E patients had severe disease. The 5 patients who were found to be anti-HEV IgG-reactive recovered within 6 months of follow-up. Of the 13 HCV cases, alanine transaminase (ALT) levels returned to normal in 7 (53. 8\%), while 6 (46.2\%) continued to show abnormal ALT after 6 months of follow-up. However, 9 (69.2\%) of them remained HCV-RNA-positive, denoting virological/biochemical dissociation. Long-term follow-up showed a reappearance of HCV RNA in 2 of the 4 patients who were in virological remission performing 84\% of chronicity rate. Acute non-A-E hepatitis patients were less likely to evolve toward chronicity, as compared with acute HCV cases (16\% vs. 84\%; P =.0001). Only 4 (16\%) of the non-A-E patients were hepatitis G virus (HGV)-RNA-positive. Concerning risk factors for acquiring parenterally transmitted viruses, tattooing was the only one that could be associated with HCV transmission (P =.002). No risk factors could be identified for putative non-A-E virus transmission. Liver biopsies performed for chronic HCV patients showed a variable degree of inflammation, while the non-A-E patients presented less severe histological disease.},

Here, we present a bio-informatic analysis of HCV-1a populations isolated from 23 children with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) subjected to interferon-ribavirin therapy. The structures of the viral quasispecies were established based on a 132-amino-acid sequence derived from E1/E2 protein, including hyper-variable region 1 (HVR1). Two types of HCV populations were identified. The first type, found in non-responders, contained a small number of closely related variants. The second type, characteristic for sustained responders, was composed of a large number of distantly associated equal-rank variants. Comparison of 445 HVR1 sequences showed that a significant number of variants present in non-responding patients are closely related, suggesting that certain, still unidentified properties of the pathogen may be key factors determining the result of CHC treatment.},

Infection with the hepatitis E virus (HEV) may be related to acute illness, liver failure, chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. HEV itself is an RNA virus, with eight described genotypes (HEV 1-8), four of which more commonly affect humans and have, thus, been better studied. Besides liver manifestations, genotype 3 is also related to extra-hepatic manifestations, such as neurological, renal and rheumatological. Evolution to chronic disease occurs especially in patients who underwent transplantation, have hematological malignancies requiring chemotherapy, or have infection with the human immunodeficiency virus. The diagnosis may be difficult because of the low availability of tests and due to low sensibility and specificity. The acute form of illness does not have to be treated, but the chronic one does.

	abstract = {Between November 1993 and April 1994, our physicians' team interviewed and took blood samples of 631 prisoners randomly drawn from the largest prison of South America, which counted about 4700 inmates at that time. The interview consisted of questions related to risk behaviour for HIV infection, and the subjects were asked to provide blood for serological tests for HIV, hepatitis C and syphilis. Our main purpose was to investigate the relationship between HCV and injecting drug use as related to HIV seropositivity. Participation in the study was voluntary and con®dentiality was guaranteed. Overall prevalences found were as follows: HIV: 16\% (95\% con®dence interval (CI): 13±19\%); HCV: 34\% (95\% CI: 30±38\%), and syphilis: 18\% (95\% CI: 15±21\%). Acknowledged use of ever injecting drug was 22\% and no other parenteral risk was reported. Our results, as compared with other studies in the same prison, suggest that HIV prevalence has been stable in recent years, and that the major risk factor for HIV infection in this population is parenteral exposure by injecting drug use.},

	abstract = {Since 2007, most of humanity resides in urban areas, a trend which continues worldwide. Diseases usually associated with rural contexts are now emerging or newly recognised in cities. In the neighbourhood of São Bartolomeu in Salvador, Brazil, the prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni infection in 2011 was {\textgreater}20\%. Following enrollment and treatment of a portion of the community, {\textasciitilde}25\% of the area underwent urban renewal. In 2015, we returned to enrol individuals who had previously participated and a cohort that had not taken part in 2011. Thus, infected individuals in one group experienced specific drug treatment plus improved living conditions and the second group only improved living conditions. Between 2011 and 2015 there were no organised treatment programs, but adequate sanitation increased from 69\% to 92\% coverage, household flooding decreased, and the presence of indoor toilets increased to 99\% of households. Ownership of household appliances also increased significantly. The overall prevalence of schistosome infections was 6.2\%. In 2015, the cohort first seen in 2011 had a higher prevalence (8.7\%) than those first seen in 2015 (4.8\%) and showed a few demographic differences. The 2011 cohort was older, more likely born in Salvador, less likely to have lived outside of Salvador, spent a greater percentage of their lifetime in Salvador, but more likely to have travelled. The population structure of the parasites from both cohorts underwent a marked change with similar increased component and infrapopulation differentiation and {\textgreater}10 fold decrease in effective population size. There was a 4–5 year shift in age-specific prevalence in 2015 for all compared with 2011. While praziquantel may have helped reduce prevalence, our evidence suggests that the structural changes and improvements in living conditions had the biggest impact on schistosomiasis in this community.},

Nuestro conocimiento sobre esa enfermedad se ha construido a través de estudios en animales de experimentación. Hay muchas preguntas sin respuesta que rodean la patogénesis de la rabia, a pesar del avance observado en los últimos tiempos. Las neuronas infectadas con rabia no pueden funcionar normalmente debido a cambios degenerativos que afectan a procesos neurales, incluyendo a dendritas y axones. Las infecciones causadas por el virus natural de la rabia no pueden eliminarse del sistema nervioso central, ya que los efectores inmunológicos no pueden ser transportados a los tejidos del cerebro, debido a la permeabilidad de la barrera hematoencefálica. No existe una terapia eficaz contra la rabia humana. El estado de coma terapéutico (inducido) ha fracasado sistemáticamente. Una mejor comprensión de la patogénesis de la rabia puede aportar nuevas ideas para el desarrollo de terapias modernas contra la rabia humana. Palabras clave: Factores de Virulencia; Rabia; Encefalitis Viral. INTRODUCCIÓN La rabia humana permanece siendo un importante problema de salud pública, responsable por, como 51 mínimo, 55 mil casos fatales por año . La rabia humana se puede prevenir de forma eficaz, pero, permanece siendo una enfermedad casi invariablemente fatal, a despecho de 14 la existencia de conductas terapéuticas agresivas . Nuestro conocimiento básico acerca de la patogénesis de la rabia puede dejar algunos temas importantes sin respuesta. Una mejor comprensión de la patogénesis de la rabia puede ser muy útil para conseguir avanzar en el futuro, en la terapia para la rabia humana. En esta revisión, serán discutidos algunos asuntos seleccionados sobre la patogénesis de la rabia, con énfasis en recientes descubrimientos.},

Following the introduction of RVA immunisation in Brazil in 2006, a decreased circulation of this virus has been observed. However, AG remains an important cause of hospitalisation of paediatric patients and only limited data are available regarding the role of other enteric viruses in these cases. We conducted a prospective study of paediatric patients hospitalised for AG. Stool samples were collected to investigate human adenovirus (HAdV), RVA, norovirus (NoV) and astrovirus (AstV). NoV typing was performed by nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. From the 225 samples tested, 60 (26\%) were positive for at least one viral agent. HAdV, NoV, RVA and AstV were detected in 16\%, 8\%, 6\% and 0\% of the samples, respectively. Mixed infections were found in nine patients: HAdV/RVA (5), HAdV/NoV (3) and HAdV/NoV/RVA (1). The frequency of fever and lymphocytosis was significantly higher in virus-infected patients. Phylogenetic analysis of NoV indicated that all of these viruses belonged to genotype GII.4. The significant frequency of these pathogens in patients with AG highlights the need to routinely implement laboratory investigations.},

	abstract = {One of the major problems facing environmental health officials in regard to water quality is related principally to the unavailability of reliable and standard methods to concentrate, detect, and isolate low-multiplicities of virus from very large volumes of water. The critical examination of all water supplies for the presence of viruses (including waters used for drinking, recreation, and food production) requires a quantitative approach. In order to be quantitative, measurable quantities of water must be examined. This is the only way in which a definitive assessment can be made as to the distribution and extent of virus contamination of our water resources. The challenge to the virologist is related to the need for developing new and/or improved techniques in the laboratory that have a high likelihood for adaptation to the real world situation. In this regard, a number of techniques have been shown experimentally to be good candidates for assessing the occurrence of viruses in various types of water. The most promising methods are: (i) membrane-adsorption technique; (ii) adsorption to precipitable salts, iron oxide, and polyelectrolytes; (iii) aqueous polymer two-phase separation technique; and (iv) soluble alginate filter technique. Most of these methods have shown good-to-excellent virus recovery efficiencies as well as a reasonable efficacy for concentrating viruses from water in controlled laboratory experiments. Other methods such as (i) continuous-flow ultracentrifugation; (ii) forced-flow electrophoresis and electro-osmosis, and (iii) hydroextraction have also shown favorable virus recovery efficiencies under laboratory-controlled conditions but fall short as candidate techniques for real world virus-in-water problems. From the data, it would appear that the most promising methods for detecting and isolating low-multiplicities of virus in clean and finished waters are those that rely on virus adsorption and/or retention coupled with a flow-through sampling system. For waters that are moderately or grossly turbid, it would appear that aqueous polymer two-phase separation may be the better approach. In this review paper, the above methods are briefly described in terms of mechanisms, procedure and efficiency. The methods are evaluated in terms of speed, simplicity, and economy of application. © 1971.},

The study area was chosen in the States of Acre and Rondonia where most cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV)/HDV are reported. From December 2003 to October 2004, 40 HBsAg carriers with anti-HDV IgM were selected. An epidemiologic questionnaire, including demographic and clinical/epidemiologic variables was filled out. HDV amplification and genotyping were performed. Genotype I was detected in 22 patients (55.0\%), whereas genotype III was identified in 18 (45.0\%). Patients who were infected with genotype I were older (45.1 ?? 17.8 years) than patients infected with genotype III (32.8 ?? 10.9 years; P = 0.01). No symptoms were reported by 21 (52.5\%) patients. Otherwise, 19 (47.5\%) had symptoms (fatigue, abdominal pain, weight loss, and decompensated liver disease) that motivated them to seek medical care. Genotype III carriers were more symptomatic, but no statistical significance was achieved. Our preliminary results show that HDV genotypes I and III are present in Brazilian Amazonia and that HDV genotype III is not limited to the Amerindian population.

	abstract = {Motivation: Computational annotation of protein coding genes in genomic DNA is a widely used and essential tool for analyzing newly sequenced genomes. However, current methods suffer from inaccuracy and do poorly with certain types of genes. Including additional sources of evidence of the existence and structure of genes can improve the quality of gene predictions. For many eukaryotic genomes, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are available as evidence for genes. Related genomes that have been sequenced, annotated, and aligned to the target genome provide evidence of existence and structure of genes. Results: We incorporate several different evidence sources into the gene finder AUGUSTUS. The sources of evidence are gene and transcript annotations from related species syntenically mapped to the target genome using TRANSMAP, evolutionary conservation of DNA, mRNA and ESTs of the target species, and retroposed genes. The predictions include alternative splice variants where evidence supports it. Using only ESTs we were able to correctly predict at least one splice form exactly correct in 57\% of human genes. Also using evidence from other species and human mRNAs, this number rises to 77\%. Syntenic mapping is well-suited to annotate genomes closely related to genomes that are already annotated or for which extensive transcript evidence is available. Native cDNA evidence is most helpful when the alignments are used as compound information rather than independent positionwise information. Availability: AUGUSTUS is open source and available at http:// augustus.gobics.de. The gene predictions for human can be browsed and downloaded at the UCSC Genome Browser (http://},

	abstract = {To improve the reliability and credibility of genotyping hepatitis E virus (HEV) and to explore the possibility of unifying standards of HEV genotyping by designing HEV universal primers for amplification of a long genomic fragment of different HEV genotypes. A set of universal primers (HEVuPrimer) was designed based on conserved regions determined by alignment analysis of 82 HEV strains with complete genome in GenBank. HEVuPrimer was compared with a set of previously used primers (MXJ primers) for their sequence-matching to different HEV strains and applied to amplify HEV genomic fragments from HEV reference strains with known different genotypes and clinical serum samples with anti-HEV-IgM by RT-nPCR. HEV genotyping based on the fragments amplified with HEVuPrimer was compared and validated with that based on HEV full genome and fragments obtained with MXJ primers. HEV genotyping by the phylogenetic analysis supplemented with the percent of nucleotide identity of the HEVuPrimer-determined fragments showed good correspondence with that based on HEV full-length genome. In addition, HEVuPrimer was much better than MXJ primers in matching sequences of HEV strains available from GenBank, and was able to amplify all the reference HEV strains with different genotypes. Among 124 samples with anti-HEV-IgM, 60 were positive for HEV RNA determined by a 644bp amplicon of RT-nPCR with the HEVuPrimenr. All the positive isolates belonged to HEV genotype 4 with nucleotide homology of 80.0\%-99.9\%, and could be further divided into 4 subgenotypes. Moreover, a novel subtype was identified with 6 HEV strains isolated very recently. The RT-nPCR using the HEVuPrimer and phylogenetic analysis of the amplified region provided strong evidences for its feasibility in HEV genetic classification. Our data have new implication for the consensus of genotype classification of HEV.},

Two negative-control plasma samples were included. All samples were blinded. The plasma samples were prepared as liquid/frozen materials and distributed to participants on dry ice. Laboratories were requested to test the panel using their routine HEV assays and to score samples as either positive or negative and could optionally return data in copies/ml for HEV RNA. Twenty laboratories from 10 different countries participated in the study. Data were returned by all participating laboratories; 10 laboratories returned quantitative data. All assays except one were developed in-house using conventional or real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) methodologies. There was a 100-to 1,000-fold difference in sensitivity between the majority of assays, independent of the virus strain. Although the quantitative data were limited, for the samples in the range of ̃6 to 4 log10 copies/ml, the standard deviations of the geometric means of the samples ranged between 0.38 and 1.09. Except for one equivocal result, HEV RNA was not detected in the negative samples. The variability of assay sensitivity highlights the need for the standardization of HEV RNA NAT assays.

In the present study, we evaluated and compared different nucleic acid amplification technique (NAT) methods for the detection of HEV in blood components. Minipools of a total of 16,125 individual blood donors were screened for the presence of HEV RNA using the highly sensitive RealStar HEV RT-PCR kit, revealing a minimum detection limit of 4.66 IU/ml. Thirteen donors were HEV RNA positive (0.08\%), and of these donors, only three already showed reactive IgM antibody titers. The detected HEV strains all belonged to genotype 3 and were most closely related to German HEV strains from wild boars and pigs as well as from human hepatitis E cases. Furthermore, HEV RNA and HEV-specific IgM and IgG titers were determined in 136 blood donors with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and in 200 donors without pathological findings. HEV RNA was not detectable, but 8.08\% (elevated ALT) and 0.5\% (nonelevated ALT) of donors showed reactive HEV IgM titers. The overall seroprevalence rate of HEV IgG amounted to 5.94\% (elevated ALT, 5.88\%; nonelevated ALT, 6.0\%). The clinical relevance of transfusion-associated hepatitis E infection still requires further investigation.

We now report on the cloning and nucleotide sequencing of an overlapping, contiguous set of cDNA clones representing the entire genome of the HEV Burma strain [HEV(B)]. The largest open reading frame extends approximately 5 kb from the Fend and contains the RNA-directed RNA polymerase and nucleoside triphosphate binding motifs. The second major open reading frame (ORF2) begins 37 by downstream of the first and extends approximately 2 kb to the termination codon present 65 by from the 3' terminal stretch of poly(A) residues. ORF2 contains a consensus signal peptide sequence at its amino terminus and a capsid-like region with a high content of basic amino acids similar to that seen with other virus capsid proteins. A third open reading frame partially overlaps the first and second and encompasses only 369 bp. In addition to the 7.5-kb full-length genomic transcript, two subgenomic polyadenylated messages of approximately 3.7 and 2.0 kb were detected in infected liver using a probe from the 3' third of the genome. The genomic organization of the virus is consistent with the Fend encoding nonstructural and the 3' end encoding the viral structural gene(s). The expression strategy of the virus involves the use of three different open reading frames and at least three different transcripts. HEV was previously determined to be a nonenveloped particle with a diameter of 27-34 nm. These findings on the genetic organization and expression strategy of HEV suggest that it is the prototype human pathogen for a new class of RNA virus or perhaps a separate genus within the Caliciviridae family. © 1991.},

	abstract = {Background: Hepatitis E (HEV) is an important public-health concern as a major cause of enterically transmitted hepatitis worldwide. In industrialised countries it is considered rare, and largely confined to travellers returning from endemic areas. However, autochthonous (locally acquired) HEV infection is also emerging in these regions. The infection is caused by different genotypes, depending on whether it is travel-related or autochthonous. Conventional RT-PCR followed by sequencing of PCR products can identify HEV genotype and, depending on the region, the subtype, thus helping in defining the origin of infection and tracing the source of contamination. Methods. We re-analysed a collection of serum samples previously confirmed as hepatitis E positive by anti-HEV IgM and IgG assays as well as by Real-Time PCR, with the aim to compare the performances of five different broad range RT-PCR assays that could be provided for molecular characterisation of HEV. This approach is certainly valuable to investigate the molecular epidemiology of acute hepatitis E in countries where co-circulation of different genotypes occurs, like Italy. Results: Samples were analyzed by five assays targeting the ORF1, ORF2, and ORF2/3 regions. The sensitivity of these assays varied significantly, depending on the target region. Only 46\% of samples tested positive by nested PCR; moreover, no single method was able to detect all positive samples. Most sequences originated from patients who had travelled to endemic areas (genotype 1), while the minority originated from Italian patients with no travel history (genotype 3). Conclusion: Broad range methods for molecular characterization of HEV still need to be improved to detect all circulating strains. © 2014 La Rosa et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The viral agent responsible for this form of epidemic, or enterically transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis (ET-NANBH), has been serially transmitted in cynomolgus macaques (cynos) and has resulted in typical elevation in liver enzymes and the detection of characteristic virus-like particles (VLPs) in both feces and bile. Infectious bile was used for the construction of recombinant complementary DNA libraries. One clone, ET1.1, was exogenous to uninfected human and cyno genomic liver DNA, as well as to genomic DNA from infected cyno liver. ET1.1 did however, hybridize to an approximately 7.6-kilobase RNA species present only in infected cyno liver. The translated nucleic acid sequence of a portion of ET1.1 had a consensus amino acid motif consistent with an RNA-directed RNA polymerase; this enzyme is present in all positive strand RNA viruses. Furthermore, ET1.1 specifically identified similar sequences in complementary DNA prepared from infected human fecal samples collected from five geographically distinct ET-NANBH outbreaks. Therefore, ET1.1 represents a portion of the genome of the principal viral agent, to be named hepatitis E virus, which is responsible for epidemic outbreaks of ET-NANBH.},

Whole-cell T. cruzi extracts or recombinant proteins have shown variation in the performance and cross-reactivity. Synthetic chimeric proteins comprising fragments of repetitive amino acids of several different proteins have been shown to improve assay performances to detect Chagasic infections. Here, we describe the production of four chimeric T. cruzi proteins and the assessment of their performance for diagnostic purposes. Circular Dichroism spectra indicated the absence of well-defined secondary structures, while polydispersity evaluated by Dynamic Light Scattering revealed only minor aggregates in 50 mM carbonate-bicarbonate (pH 9.6), demonstrating that it is an appropriate buffering system for sensitizing microplates. Serum samples from T. cruzi-infected and non-infected individuals were used to assess the performance of these antigens for detecting antibodies against T. cruzi, using both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a liquid bead array platform. Performance parameters (AUC, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and J index) showed high diagnostic accuracy for all chimeric proteins for detection of specific anti-T. cruzi antibodies and differentiated seropositive individuals from those who were seronegative. Our data suggest that these four chimeric proteins are eligible for phase II studies.},

Since its first appearance in China in December 2019, the pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world. Despite considerable efforts made to contain the disease, the virus has continued its prevalence in many countries with varying degrees of clinical manifestations. To contain this pandemic, collaborative approach involving accurate diagnosis, epidemiology, surveillance, and prophylaxis is essential. However, proper diagnosis using rapid technologies plays a crucial role. With increasing incidence of COVID-19 cases, the accurate and early detection of the SARS-CoV-2 is need of the hour for effective prevention and management of COVID-19 cases as well as to curb its spread. RT-qPCR assay is considered to be the gold standard for the early detection of virus, but this protocol has limited application to use as bedside test because of its technical complexity. To address these challenges, several POC assays have been developed to facilitate the COVID-19 diagnosis outside the centralized testing laboratories as well to accelerate the clinical decision making with a least turnaround time. Hence, in this report, we review different nucleic acid-based and serological techniques available for the diagnosis and effective prevention of COVID-19. Key points: • Provides comprehensive information on the different diagnostic tools available for COVID-19 • Nucleic acid based tests or antigen detection tests are used for diagnostic purpose • Accurate diagnosis is essential for the efficient management of COVID-19.},

Nevertheless, endemic-epidemic transmissible diseases are still a relevant public health problem in Brazil. New diseases or long-known ones (re)appear in different ecological and social contexts. The intervention of health services in complex networks that disseminate infections is limited by macro-structural determinants of the health-disease process, social exclusion, migration, and urban inequality, as highlighted by many authors. However, identifying vulnerable points on the paths of several domestic endemic and epidemic diseases has been one of the main challenges for health professionals, managers and researchers. We are witnessing the growth in circulating viruses, bacteria and parasites with the (re)emergence of diseases, and their resistance to anti-microbial drugs and insecticides, as well as the adaptation of vectors and microorganisms to new ecological and social scenarios. There is still much to learn about transmissible diseases in the country, even about those that have been widely studied and are traditional public health problems. There is a wide-range of questions to answer , from the molecular intimacy of biological processes to the assessment of national policies for disease control. Different approaches on disease occurrence and dissemination enrich debate. Studies on epidemic trends and behaviors help predict risk situations. New technologies for early detection and identification of strains of microorganisms explain the paths of transmission better. More powerful and specific medication and immunotherapeutic agents may determine successful control of en-demic and epidemic diseases in the country.

Next-generation sequencing and culture-independent approaches were used to describe and quantify microbial communities in watersheds with different land use in British Columbia. Deep amplicon sequencing was used to investigate the distribution of certain viruses (g23 and RdRp), bacteria (16S rRNA and cpn60), and eukaryotes (18S rRNA and ITS). Metagenomic sequencing was used to further characterize the gene content of the bacterial and viral fractions at both taxonomic and functional levels.

However, AG remains an important cause of hospitalisation of paediatric patients and only limited data are available regarding the role of other enteric viruses in these cases. We conducted a prospective study of paediatric patients hospitalised for AG. Stool samples were collected to investigate human adenovirus (HAdV), RVA, norovirus (NoV) and astrovirus (AstV). NoV typing was performed by nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. From the 225 samples tested, 60 (26\%) were positive for at least one viral agent.

We compared the efficiency of four different extraction techniques in serum and stool samples for the detection of hepatitis A virus by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). We used PCR to analyse serum and stool samples of 12 patients who were referred to the Brazilian Reference Center for Viral Hepatitis (BRCVH) in Rio de Janeiro. The methods tested were Proteinase K, Silica, TRIzol and Guanidine isothiocyanate. Proteinase K extraction was the best method for serum samples; it detected the HAV-RNA in 11 of the 12 samples. The guanidine isothiocyanate method was the most effective for stool samples, detecting HAV-RNAs in 9 of the samples. The TRIzol(R) method worked best with serum samples, and the silica method was unsatisfactory with both serum and stool samples. The RNA extraction method affected the outcome. The use of appropriate RNA extraction methods is a critical step for successful and valid PCR studies on clinical samples.

	abstract = {Noroviruses are genetically diverse RNA viruses associated with acute gastroenteritis in mammalian hosts. Phylogenetically, they can be segregated into different genogroups as well as P (polymerase)-groups and further into genotypes and P-types based on amino acid diversity of the complete VP1 gene and nucleotide diversity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region of ORF1, respectively. In recent years, several new noroviruses have been reported that warrant an update of the existing classification scheme. Using previously described 2× standard deviation (sd) criteria to group sequences into separate clusters, we expanded the number of genogroups to 10 (GI-GX) and the number of genotypes to 49 (9 GI, 27 GII, 3 GIII, 2 GIV, 2 GV, 2 GVI and 1 genotype each for GVII, GVIII, GIX [formerly GII.15] and GX). Viruses for which currently only one sequence is available in public databases were classified into tentative new genogroups (GNA1 and GNA2) and genotypes (GII.NA1, GII.NA2 and GIV.NA1) with their definitive assignment awaiting additional related sequences. Based on nucleotide diversity in the RdRp region, noroviruses can be divided into 60 P-types (14 GI, 37 GII, 2 GIII, 1 GIV, 2 GV, 2 GVI, 1 GVII and 1 GX), 2 tentative P-groups and 14 tentative P-types. Future classification and nomenclature updates will be based on complete genome sequences and will be coordinated and disseminated by the international norovirus classification-working group.},

Nuestro conocimiento sobre esa enfermedad se ha construido a través de estudios en animales de experimentación. Hay muchas preguntas sin respuesta que rodean la patogénesis de la rabia, a pesar del avance observado en los últimos tiempos. Las neuronas infectadas con rabia no pueden funcionar normalmente debido a cambios degenerativos que afectan a procesos neurales, incluyendo a dendritas y axones. Las infecciones causadas por el virus natural de la rabia no pueden eliminarse del sistema nervioso central, ya que los efectores inmunológicos no pueden ser transportados a los tejidos del cerebro, debido a la permeabilidad de la barrera hematoencefálica. No existe una terapia eficaz contra la rabia humana. El estado de coma terapéutico (inducido) ha fracasado sistemáticamente. Una mejor comprensión de la patogénesis de la rabia puede aportar nuevas ideas para el desarrollo de terapias modernas contra la rabia humana. Palabras clave: Factores de Virulencia; Rabia; Encefalitis Viral. INTRODUCCIÓN La rabia humana permanece siendo un importante problema de salud pública, responsable por, como 51 mínimo, 55 mil casos fatales por año . La rabia humana se puede prevenir de forma eficaz, pero, permanece siendo una enfermedad casi invariablemente fatal, a despecho de 14 la existencia de conductas terapéuticas agresivas . Nuestro conocimiento básico acerca de la patogénesis de la rabia puede dejar algunos temas importantes sin respuesta. Una mejor comprensión de la patogénesis de la rabia puede ser muy útil para conseguir avanzar en el futuro, en la terapia para la rabia humana.

Nine sets of species specific primer pairs were also selected to identify and distinguish species, i.e., yellow fever, West Nile, Murray Valley encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis and dengue type 1 to 4 viruses. This method required only two hours for completion using infected culture fluid, thus facilitating rapid identification of mosquito-borne flavivirus species. © 1993.},

Thus, faecal samples from hospitalised diarrhoeic children, under six years of age, were collected and tested for the presence of norovirus (NoV), adenovirus (AdV) and astrovirus (AstV) from February 2010-February 2012. Specimens were screened by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and viruses were found in 10.7\% (63/591) of the cases. NoV, AdV and AstV were detected in 7.8\%, 2\% and 0.8\% of the samples, respectively. NoV infection was observed at all ages and was most prevalent in zero-18-month-old children (84.7\%; p = 0.002). A higher incidence of NoV was detected from February-April 2010, when it was found in 52.2\% of the cases. Co-infections involving these viruses, rotavirus and enteropathogenic bacteria were detected in 44.4\% (28/63) of the children with viral diarrhoea. Nosocomial infections were demonstrated in 28.6\% (18/63) of the cases in which viruses were detected. The present paper reports, for the first time, the circulation of NoV and AstV among the paediatric population of Porto Velho and it contributes to our understanding of the roles of these pathogens in gastrointestinal infections.},

	abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of COVID-19. Most of SARS-CoV-2 carriers are assumed to exhibit no or mild non-specific symptoms. Thus, they may contribute to the rapid and mostly silent circulation of the virus among humans. Since SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples it has recently been proposed to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters (WW) as a complementary tool to investigate virus circulation in human populations. In the present work we assumed that the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewaters should correlate with the number of symptomatic or non-symptomatic carriers. To test this hypothesis, we performed a time-course quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR in raw wastewater samples collected from several major wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of the Parisian area. The study was conducted from March 5 to April 23 2020, therefore including the lockdown period in France (since March 17 2020). We confirmed that the increase of genome units in raw wastewaters accurately followed the increase of human COVID-19 cases observed at the regional level. Of note, the viral genomes could be detected before the beginning of the exponential growth of the epidemic. As importantly, a marked decrease in the quantities of genomes units was observed concomitantly with the reduction in the number of new COVID-19 cases which was an expected consequence of the lockdown. As a conclusion, this work suggests that a quantitative monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewaters should bring important and additional information for an improved survey of SARS-CoV-2 circulation at the local or regional scale.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementAnalysis were carried on the Eau de Paris 2020 Research grant.

In the absence of a vaccine or efficient treatment, cost-effective epidemiological surveillance strategies are urgently needed. Methods: Here, we have used RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection in a series of longitudinal metropolitan wastewaters samples collected during the earliest stages of the epidemic in the Region of Valencia, Spain. Results: We were able to consistently detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in samples taken when communicated cases in that region were only incipient. We also find that the wastewater viral RNA context increased rapidly and anticipated the subsequent ascent in the number of declared cases. Interpretation: Our results strongly suggest that the virus was undergoing community transmission earlier than previously believed, and show that wastewater analysis is a sensitive and cost-effective strategy for COVID-19 epidemiological surveillance. Routine implementation of this surveillance tool would significantly improve our preparedness against new or re-occurring viral outbreaks. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. \#\#\# Funding Statement This research was funded by CSIC 202070E101 grant and AGL2017-82909 (AEI/FEDER, UE) funded by Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities to G.S. and ERC Consolidator Grant 724519-Vis-à-Vis to R.S.

In order to be quantitative, measurable quantities of water must be examined. This is the only way in which a definitive assessment can be made as to the distribution and extent of virus contamination of our water resources. The challenge to the virologist is related to the need for developing new and/or improved techniques in the laboratory that have a high likelihood for adaptation to the real world situation. In this regard, a number of techniques have been shown experimentally to be good candidates for assessing the occurrence of viruses in various types of water. The most promising methods are: (i) membrane-adsorption technique; (ii) adsorption to precipitable salts, iron oxide, and polyelectrolytes; (iii) aqueous polymer two-phase separation technique; and (iv) soluble alginate filter technique. Most of these methods have shown good-to-excellent virus recovery efficiencies as well as a reasonable efficacy for concentrating viruses from water in controlled laboratory experiments. Other methods such as (i) continuous-flow ultracentrifugation; (ii) forced-flow electrophoresis and electro-osmosis, and (iii) hydroextraction have also shown favorable virus recovery efficiencies under laboratory-controlled conditions but fall short as candidate techniques for real world virus-in-water problems. From the data, it would appear that the most promising methods for detecting and isolating low-multiplicities of virus in clean and finished waters are those that rely on virus adsorption and/or retention coupled with a flow-through sampling system. For waters that are moderately or grossly turbid, it would appear that aqueous polymer two-phase separation may be the better approach. In this review paper, the above methods are briefly described in terms of mechanisms, procedure and efficiency. The methods are evaluated in terms of speed, simplicity, and economy of application. © 1971.},

	abstract = {Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are partial sequences from the extremities of complementary DNA (cDNA) resulting from a single pass sequencing of clones from cDNA libraries, and different ESTs can be obtained from one gene. Sequence information from ESTs can be used for deciphering the function and the organisation of the genome. From a functional viewpoint, they allow the determination of the expression profiles of genes in any particular tissue, in different conditions or status, and thus the identification of regulated genes. In order to identify genes involved in particular processes one can select a specific group of mRNAs. For such a selection, classical techniques include subtraction or differential screening and new techniques, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, are now available. For studies on the organisation of the genome the main use of ESTs is the determination of chromosomal localisation of the corresponding genes using a somatic hybrid cell panel. This chromosomal localisation information is needed to identify genes or quantitative trait loci, according to the 'positional candidate' approach. ESTs also contribute to comparative genetics and they can help to decipher gene function by comparison between species, even genetically distant ones. Thus, combining sequence, functional and localisation data, ESTs contribute to an integrated approach to the genome.},

The natural presence of resistance associated substitutions (RASs), as well as their rapid emergence during incomplete drug-pressure, are intrinsic characteristics of HCV that greatly affect treatment outcome and the chances to achieve a virolgical cure. To date, a high number of RASs in NS3, NS5A, and NS5B have been associated in vivo and/or in vitro with reduced susceptibility to DAAs, but no comprehensive RASs list is available. This review thus provides an updated, systematic overview of the role of RASs to currently approved DAAs or in phase II/III of clinical development against HCV-infection, discriminating their impact in different HCV-genotypes and DAAs, providing assistance for a fruitful use of HCV resistance testing in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {The studies on hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in prison populations are few and mostly cross-sectional. We analyzed prevalently the articles appearing on PubMed in the last ten years. HCV infection is frequent in prisoners, prevalences ranging from 3.1\% to 38\% according to the HCV endemicity in the geographical location of the prison and in the countries of origin of the foreign prisoners and to the prevalence of intravenous drug use, which is the most important risk factor for HCV infection, followed by an older age of prisoners and previous prison terms. HCV replication in anti-HCV-positive cases varies from 45\% to 90\% in different studies, and the most common HCV genotypes are generally 1 and 3. The response to antiviral treatment is similar in prisoners to that of the general population. Unfortunately, treatment is administered less frequently to prisoners because of the difficulties in management and follow-up. The new directly acting antivirals offer a good therapy option for inmates because of their good efficacy, short duration of treatment and low incidence of side effects. The efforts of the prison authorities and medical staff should be focused on reducing the spread of HCV infection in prisons by extending the possibility of follow-up and treatment to more prisoners with chronic hepatitis C.},

	abstract = {Protein sequence similarity searching programs like BLASTP, SSEARCH, and FASTA use scoring matrices that are designed to identify distant evolutionary relationships (BLOSUM62 for BLAST, BLOSUM50 for SSEARCH and FASTA). Different similarity scoring matrices are most effective at different evolutionary distances. "Deep" scoring matrices like BLOSUM62 and BLOSUM50 target alignments with 20\% to 30\% identity, while "shallow" scoring matrices (e.g., VTML10 to VTML80) target alignments that share 90\% to 50\% identity, reflecting much less evolutionary change. While "deep" matrices provide very sensitive similarity searches, they also require longer sequence alignments and can sometimes produce alignment overextension into nonhomologous regions. Shallower scoring matrices are more effective when searching for short protein domains, or when the goal is to limit the scope of the search to sequences that are likely to be orthologous between recently diverged organisms. Likewise, in DNA searches, the match and mismatch parameters set evolutionary look-back times and domain boundaries. In this unit, we will discuss the theoretical foundations that drive practical choices of protein and DNA similarity scoring matrices and gap penalties. Deep scoring matrices (BLOSUM62 and BLOSUM50) should be used for sensitive searches with full-length protein sequences, but short domains or restricted evolutionary look-back require shallower scoring matrices. © 2013 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Accurate, rapid, and early diagnosis of dengue virus (DENV) infections is essential for optimal clinical care. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)-LightMix dengue virus EC kit for DENV detection using samples from a dengue outbreak in Taiwan in 2015. Methods: Sera from patients with suspected DENV infection were analyzed and compared using the LightMix kit, a Dengue NS1 Ag + Ab Combo kit for detection of NS1 antigen and DENV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies, and an “in-house” qualitative DENV-specific RT-PCR assay. Results: A total of 8,989, 8,954, and 1581 samples were subjected to NS1 antigen detection, IgM and IgG detection, and LightMix assays, respectively. The LightMix assay yielded a linear curve for viral loads (VL) between 102 and 106 copies/reaction, and the minimum detection limits for DENV serotype 1 (DENV1) and DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4 were 1, 10, and 100 focus forming units (FFU)/mL, respectively. There was 88.9\% concordance between the results obtained using the NS1 antigen combo kit and by LightMix analysis, and the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the two methods were 89.4 and 100\%, and 84.7 and 100\%, respectively. Notably, fatal cases were attributed to DENV2 infection, and 79.5\% (27/34) of these cases occurred in patients ≥ 71 years of age. Among these older patients, 82.3\% (14/17) were NS1/IgM/IgG (+/-/-), exhibiting VLs between 106–109 copies/mL, which was markedly higher than the rate observed in the other age groups. Conclusions: The LightMix assay was effective for early diagnosis of DENV infection. Our data indicate that high VLs during primary infection in elderly patients may be a positive predictor for severe illness, and may contribute to high mortality rates.},

Serotype- and group-specific oligonucleotide primers and fluorogenic probes were designed against conserved regions of the dengue virus genome. The RT-PCR assay is a rapid single-tube method consisting of a 30-min RT step linked to a 45-cycle PCR at 95 and 60°C that generates a fluorogenic signal in positive samples. Assays were initially evaluated against cell culture-derived dengue stock viruses and then with 67 dengue viremic human sera received from Peru, Indonesia, and Taiwan. The TaqMan assays were compared to virus isolation using C6/36 cells followed by an immunofluorescence assay using serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies. Viral titers in sera were determined by plaque assay in Vero cells. The serotype-specific TaqMan RT-PCR assay detected 62 of 67 confirmed dengue virus-positive samples, for a sensitivity of 92.5\%, while the group-specific assay detected 66 of 67 confirmed dengue virus-positive samples, for a sensitivity of 98.5\%. The TaqMan RT-PCR assays have a specificity of 100\% based on the serotype concordance of all assays compared to cell culture isolation and negative results obtained when 21 normal human sera and plasma samples were tested. Our results demonstrate that the dengue virus TaqMan RT-PCR assays may be utilized as rapid, sensitive, and specific screening and serotyping tools for epidemiological studies of dengue virus infections.},

Previously to the availability of pegylated interferon, daily induction therapy with standard interferon was under evaluation. Aims - To evaluate the safety and efficacy of interferon alpha daily induction regimen in combination with ribavirin. Patients and methods - A randomized trial including 93 patients with chronic hepatitis C was carried out. On satisfying all eligibility criteria, patients were randomly allocated to two different treatment groups: 44 individuals in treatment arm A: IFN 3 MU thrice weekly + ribavirin 1.0-1.2 g daily for 48 weeks (IFN TIW) and 49 individuals in treatment arm B: IFN 3 MU daily + ribavirin 1.0-1.2 g daily for 12 weeks followed by IFN 3 MU thrice weekly + ribavirin 1.0-1.2 g daily, until completion of 48 weeks of therapy (IFN QD). HCV genotyping was obtained in 85 subjects. A negative HCV-RNA 6 months after cessation of therapy was considered a sustained virological response. Results - Eighty three patients completed treatment, five dropped out (one from IFN TIW and four from IFN QD) and in five patients therapy was discontinued due to medical request (two from IFN TIW and three from IFN QD). There was no statistically significant difference between groups with respect to therapy interruption. The frequency of cirrhosis was 29\%, similar in both groups. In the "intention to treat" analysis the overall sustained virological response was 39.8\%. There was no significant difference in sustained virological response rate between both treatment strategies (36.4\% IFN TIW vs 42.9\% IFN QD). In the 83 patients who finished the trial, sustained virological response was 44.6\%. Among subjects with HCV genotype-1, the sustained virological response was 42\% (40.9\% IFN TIW vs 42.9\% IFN QD) and among patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3, the sustained virological response was 55.6\% (50\% IFN TIW vs 63.6\% IFN QD). Conclusions - Combination therapy had an overall sustained virological response rate of 39.8\% ("intention to treat analysis"). There was no difference with respect to sustained virological response rates between patients who used daily induction schedule compared to standard regimen. Adverse events, even more frequent in the daily induction group, did not interfere with the treatment strategies.},

Giardia duodenalis positive fecal samples were obtained from 71 children from two day care centers and 39 users of a clinical analysis laboratory. Samples were analyzed by PCR-RFLP of the glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) and beta-giardin genes and by the sequencing of beta-giardin.Results. Of the 110 G. duodenalis samples, 80 (72.7\%) amplified one or both target genes. Of these, 62 (77.5 \%) were identified as assemblage A and 18 (22.5\%) as assemblage B. The subassemblage AII was identified in 58.8\% (n=47) of isolates followed by the sub-assemblage AI (18.8\%, n=15), BIV (11.2\%, n=9), and BIII (5.0\%, n=4). The AII sub-assemblage was the most frequent in children of both day care centers whereas AI was found only in the group attended at the clinical laboratory. Sub-assemblage AII predominated in children under two years.Conclusions. The higher frequency of AII sub-assemblage suggests that anthroponotic transmission is more common in Salvador, but that zoonotic transmission pathways are also present and a change in susceptibility to different molecular patterns of Giardia may occur during child growth.},

Herein, we present a WWW server for an extended version of AUGUSTUS that is able to predict multiple splice variants. To our knowledge, this is the first ab initio gene finder that can predict multiple transcripts. In addition, we offer a motif searching facility, where user-defined regular expressions can be searched against putative proteins encoded by the predicted genes.

	abstract = {Motivation: Computational annotation of protein coding genes in genomic DNA is a widely used and essential tool for analyzing newly sequenced genomes. However, current methods suffer from inaccuracy and do poorly with certain types of genes. Including additional sources of evidence of the existence and structure of genes can improve the quality of gene predictions. For many eukaryotic genomes, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are available as evidence for genes. Related genomes that have been sequenced, annotated, and aligned to the target genome provide evidence of existence and structure of genes. Results: We incorporate several different evidence sources into the gene finder AUGUSTUS. The sources of evidence are gene and transcript annotations from related species syntenically mapped to the target genome using TRANSMAP, evolutionary conservation of DNA, mRNA and ESTs of the target species, and retroposed genes. The predictions include alternative splice variants where evidence supports it. Using only ESTs we were able to correctly predict at least one splice form exactly correct in 57\% of human genes. Also using evidence from other species and human mRNAs, this number rises to 77\%. Syntenic mapping is well-suited to annotate genomes closely related to genomes that are already annotated or for which extensive transcript evidence is available. Native cDNA evidence is most helpful when the alignments are used as compound information rather than independent positionwise information. Availability: AUGUSTUS is open source and available at http:// augustus.gobics.de. The gene predictions for human can be browsed and downloaded at the UCSC Genome Browser (http://},

We evaluated sera of 94 patients from a sentinel program who had acute hepatitis A (N = 40), B (N = 42) and non-A-C (N = 12); 71 blood donors served as controls. IgM and anti-HEV IgG antibodies were detected by enzyme immunoassay using commercial kits. TTV and GBV-C/HGV were detected by nested PCR; genotyping was done by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Anti-HEV IgG was present in 38, 10 and 17\% of patients with hepatitis A, B and non-A-C. Four patients with hepatitis A and 1 with non-A-C hepatitis also had anti-HEV IgM detected in serum. TTV was detected in 21\% of patients with acute hepatitis and in 31\% of donors. GBV-C/HGV was detected in 9\% of patients with hepatitis, and in 10\% of donors. We found TTV isolates of genotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 and GBV-C/HGV isolates of genotypes 1 and 2. Mean aminotransferase levels were lower in patients who were TTV or GBV-C/HGV positive. In conclusion, the detection of anti-HEV IgM in some acute hepatitis A cases suggests co-infection with HEV and hepatitis E could be the etiology of a few cases of sporadic non-A-C hepatitis in Salvador, Brazil. TTV genotype 1, 2, 3 and 4 isolates and GBV-C/HGV genotype 1 and 2 strains are frequent in the studied population. TTV and GBV-C/HGV infection does not appear to have a role in the etiology of acute hepatitis.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis C virus (HCV), discovered in 1989, is the major causative agent of parenteral non-A, non-B hepatitis worldwide. Following the development of a method of diagnosing HCV infection, it became apparent that HCV frequently causes chronic hepatitis. Persistent infection with HCV is implicated in liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current worldwide estimations suggest that more than 170 million people have been infected with HCV, an enveloped positive single-stranded RNA (9.6-kilobases) virus belonging to the Flaviviridae. The HCV genome shows remarkable sequence variation, especially in the hypervariable region 1 of the E2 protein-encoding region, and globally, HCV appears to be distributed with more than 30 genotypes. Complicated "quasispecies" and frequent mutations of viral genomes have also emerged. The HCV genome encodes a large polyprotein precursor of about 3,000 amino acid residues, and this precursor protein is cleaved by the host and viral proteinases to generate at least 10 proteins in the following order: NH2-core-envelope (E1)-E2-p7-nonstructural protein 2 (NS2)-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-NS5B-COOH. These viral proteins not only function in viral replication but also affect a variety of cellular functions. Although several explanations have been proposed, the mechanisms of HCV infection and replication in targeted cells, the mechanism of persistent viral infection, and the pathogenesis of hepatic diseases (hepatitis or hepatocellular carcinoma) are all poorly understood. A major reason why these mechanisms remain unclear is the lack of a good experimental HCV replication system. Although several classical trials using cultured cells have been reported, several new, more promising experimental strategies (generations of infectious cDNA clone, replicon, animal models, etc.) are currently being designed and tested, in order to resolve these problems. In addition, new therapies for chronic hepatitis have also been developed. The enormous body of information collected thus far in the field of HCV research is summarized below, and an overview of the current status of HCV molecular virology of HCV is provided.},

	abstract = {The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas has challenged diagnostic laboratory testing strategies. At the Wadsworth Center, ZIKV serological testing was performed for over 10,000 specimens, using a combination of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgM antibodies (Abs) to ZIKV, a polyvalent microsphere immunoassay (MIA) to detect Abs broadly reactive with flaviviruses, and a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) for further testing. Overall, 42\% of patients showed serological evidence of flavivirus infection (primarily past dengue virus [DENV] infection), while 7\% possessed IgM Abs to ZIKV and/or DENV. ZIKV IgM Abs typically arose within 3 to 4 days, with only one instance of duration beyond 100 days after reported symptoms. PRNT analysis of 826 IgM-positive specimens showed 7\% positive neutralization to ZIKV alone, 9\% to DENV alone, and 85\% to both ZIKV and DENV. Thus, the extensive Ab cross-reactivity among flaviviruses significantly reduced the value of performing PRNT analysis, especially when a traditional paired serum algorithm with viral neutralization ti-tering was used. Nevertheless, the finding of a negative ZIKV result by PRNT was invaluable for reassuring both physicians and patients. The MIA detected both IgM and IgG, which enabled us to identify patients who presented without IgM anti-ZIKV Abs but still had ZIKV-specific neutralizing Abs. On the basis of these results, a new algorithm, which included an IgM Ab capture (MAC)-ELISA to detect recent infection, a flavivirus MIA to identify patients no longer producing IgM, and a single-dilution PRNT for ZIKV exclusion and occasional discrimination of ZIKV and DENV, was implemented.},

Next generation sequencing (NGS) determines the DNA sequence of a complete bacterial genome in a single sequence run, and from these data, information on resistance and virulence, as well as information for typing is obtained, useful for outbreak investigation. The obtained genome data can be further used for the development of an outbreak-specific screening test. In this review, a general introduction to NGS is presented, including the library preparation and the major characteristics of the most common NGS platforms, such as the MiSeq (Illumina) and the Ion PGM™ (ThermoFisher). An overview of the software used for NGS data analyses used at the medical microbiology diagnostic laboratory in the University Medical Center Groningen in The Netherlands is given. Furthermore, applications of NGS in the clinical setting are described, such as outbreak management, molecular case finding, characterization and surveillance of pathogens, rapid identification of bacteria using the 16S-23S rRNA region, taxonomy, metagenomics approaches on clinical samples, and the determination of the transmission of zoonotic micro-organisms from animals to humans. Finally, we share our vision on the use of NGS in personalised microbiology in the near future, pointing out specific requirements.},

We assessed their performances compared to two existing methods, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and multivirulence-locus sequence typing (MVLST) for 128 isolates from diverse clinical settings and geographical origins. The clustering achieved by the four methods was highly congruent, with MLVA discriminating within clonal complexes as defined by MLST. Indeed, MLVA was highly discriminant compared to MLST and MVLST in terms of number of genotypes as well as diversity indexes. Sequencing of the seven VNTRs showed that they were stable, and analysis of sequence polymorphisms provided superior discriminatory power. The typeability, reproducibility, and epidemiological concordance of these new methods were excellent. Of note, no link between clustering and clinical settings was identified. This study demonstrates that MLVA and TRST provide valuable information for molecular epidemiological study of S. lugdunensis, and represent promising tools to distinguish between strains of homogenous lineages in this clonal species.},

	abstract = {Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of foodborne pathogens has become an effective method for investigating\&nbsp;the information contained in the genome sequence of bacterial pathogens. In addition, its highly discriminative power enables the comparison of genetic relatedness between bacteria even on a sub-species level. For this reason, WGS is being implemented worldwide and across sectors (human, veterinary, food, and environment) for the investigation of disease outbreaks, source attribution, and improved risk characterization models. In order to extract relevant information from the large quantity\&nbsp;and complex data produced by WGS, a host of bioinformatics tools has been developed, allowing users to analyze and interpret sequencing data, starting from simple gene-searches to complex phylogenetic studies. Depending on the research question, the complexity of the dataset and their bioinformatics skill set, users can choose between a great variety of tools for the analysis of WGS data. In this review, we describe the relevant approaches for phylogenomic studies for outbreak studies and give an overview of selected tools for the characterization of foodborne pathogens based on WGS data. Despite the efforts of the last years, harmonization and standardization of typing tools are still urgently needed to allow for an easy comparison of data between laboratories, moving towards a one health worldwide surveillance system for foodborne pathogens.},

The ability to extend that window is needed to detect ZIKV at later time points after infection, particularly in high-risk individuals such as pregnant women. We evaluated RNA extraction methods to optimize detection of ZIKV in various body fluids using RT-qPCR as a means of improving the analytical sensitivity of detection.Weoptimized methods for ZIKV RNA recovery from a number of body fluids by spiking with three varying concentrations of virus, then comparing recovery with that of spiked buffer control. RNA extraction protocols were adjusted as necessary for maximum RNA recovery. Adjustment of the elution step was essential for improved ZIKV RNA recovery from whole blood, saliva, vaginal secretions, and breast milk. Optimal recovery from urine samples required the addition of Urine Conditioning Buffer, and the use of RLT Plus buffer and RNeasy Mini Spin Columns was necessary for RNA extractions from semen samples. Optimized QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) protocol followed by the singleplex ZIKV RT-qPCR assay provided a reliable method for detection of ZIKV RNA in a variety of biological samples. Improved diagnostics are crucial for timely detection and diagnosis, particularly during pregnancy when the consequences of ZIKV infection can greatly impact the developing fetus.},

	abstract = {The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas has challenged diagnostic laboratory testing strategies. At the Wadsworth Center, ZIKV serological testing was performed for over 10,000 specimens, using a combination of an enzyme-linked im-munosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgM antibodies (Abs) to ZIKV, a polyvalent microsphere immunoassay (MIA) to detect Abs broadly reactive with flaviviruses, and a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) for further testing. Overall, 42\% of patients showed sero-logical evidence of flavivirus infection (primarily past dengue virus [DENV] infection), while 7\% possessed IgM Abs to ZIKV and/or DENV. ZIKV IgM Abs typically arose within 3 to 4 days, with only one instance of duration beyond 100 days after reported symptoms. PRNT analysis of 826 IgM-positive specimens showed 7\% positive neutralization to ZIKV alone, 9\% to DENV alone, and 85\% to both ZIKV and DENV. Thus, the extensive Ab cross-reactivity among flaviviruses significantly reduced the value of performing PRNT analysis, especially when a traditional paired serum algorithm with viral neutralization ti-tering was used. Nevertheless, the finding of a negative ZIKV result by PRNT was invaluable for reassuring both physicians and patients. The MIA detected both IgM and IgG, which enabled us to identify patients who presented without IgM anti-ZIKV Abs but still had ZIKV-specific neutralizing Abs. On the basis of these results, a new algorithm, which included an IgM Ab capture (MAC)-ELISA to detect recent infection, a flavivirus MIA to identify patients no longer producing IgM, and a single-dilution PRNT for ZIKV exclusion and occasional discrimination of ZIKV and DENV, was implemented.},

	abstract = {Brazil has a well-established immunization program in which vaccines are provided through the Public Health System free of charge to the whole population, obtaining high coverage and reducing the incidence of important infectious diseases in children and adults. However, the environmental changes and high mobility rates of the population occurring in the last decades have triggered the sequential introduction of a series of vector-borne emerging infectious diseases, such as Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya, that have imposed a considerable burden on the population, with yet unmet solutions. The first to be introduced in Brazil was the Dengue virus, reaching epidemic levels in 2010, with over 1 million cases annually, maintaining high infection rates until 2016. Brazil has invested in vaccine development. The Zika virus infection, initially assumed to have appeared during the World Cup in 2014, was later shown to have arrived earlier in 2013. Its emergence mobilized the Brazilian scientific community to define priorities and strategies, that rapidly investigated mechanisms of pathogenesis, differential diagnostics, and determined that Zika virus infection per se causes relatively mild symptoms, however, in pregnant women can cause microcephaly in the newborns. The diagnostics of Zika infection is confusing given its similar symptoms and cross-reactivity with Dengue, which also hindered the appraisal of the extent of the epidemics, which peaked in 2015 and finished in 2016. Another complicating factor was the overlap with Chikungunya virus infection, which arrived in Brazil in 2014, being prevalent in the same regions, with similar symptoms to both Dengue and Zika. Although Dengue infection can be fatal and Zika infection in pregnant woman can lead to newborns with microcephaly or an array of neurodegenerative manifestations, the Chikungunya infection is a debilitating disease leaving chronic sequelae, which unfortunately has received less attention. Precise differential diagnostics of Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya will be necessary to evaluate the actual extent of each of these diseases during this overlapping period. Here we review the impact of these emerging infections on public health and how the scientific community was mobilized to deal with them in Brazil.},

Although molecular methods are replacing many older methods of viral diagnosis, there is still a significant role for immunological methods to guide patient care and in the performance of epidemiologic studies. Identification of viral antigens in clinical samples can be accomplished rapidly through the use of point-of-care lateral immunoassays or through the use of more traditional immunofluorescence and enzyme immunoassays in the virology laboratory. Serological assays are also a valuable tool for the clinician and epidemiologist. Many of the available diagnostic assays have enzyme immunoassay formats, but functional assays such as hemagglutination-inhibition and neutralizing antibody tests are also available. In some instances, virus infection can be diagnosed with a single serum sample (e.g., HIV and hepatitis C virus infections) while in other instances paired sera are needed (e.g., those caused by common respiratory viruses). Point-of-care antibody assays are also available for testing blood and saliva samples for some viruses. An understanding of the principles of immunological detection methods is important in the application and interpretation of test results.},

The clinical virology associated with diagnostic technologies can reduce the morbidity and mortality of such neurological manifestations. Here we aimed to identify the genomes of agents that cause neurological syndromes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with suspected nervous system infections admitted to the University Hospital of the University of Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil, in 2017–2018. Methods: CSF samples collected from adult patients with neurological syndrome symptoms and negative CSF culture results were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase-PCR, and real-time PCR, and their results were compared with their clinical symptoms. One CSF sample was obtained from each patient. Results: Viral genomes were detected in 148/420 (35.2\%) CSF samples: one of 148 (0.2\%) was positive for herpes simplex virus-1; two (0.5\%) for herpes simplex virus-2; eight (1.9\%) for varicella-zoster virus; four (1\%) for Epstein-Barr virus; one (0.2\%) for cytomegalovirus; 32 (7.6\%) for human herpesvirus-6; 30 (7.1\%) for non-polio enterovirus; 67 (16.0\%) for dengue virus, three (0.7\%) for yellow fever virus, and 21 (5\%) for Zika virus. Conclusions: The viral genomes were found in 35.2\% of all analyzed samples, showing the high prevalence of viruses in the nervous system and the importance of using a nucleic acid amplification test to detect viral agents in CSF samples.},

The present retrospective study aimed to determine anti-HCV seroprevalence and describe the geographic distribution of hepatitis C in Bahia. Data from HCV serological tests submitted to the Bahia Central Laboratory of Public Health between 2004 and 2013 were analyzed. Serology for HCV was performed using the AxSYM anti-HCV enzymatic microparticle immunoassay and chemiluminescence immunoassay. A subgroup of samples with detectable HCV-RNA was genotyped using the linear array hepatitis C virus genotyping assay. A total of 247,837 samples were analyzed. The median age of the studied population was 31 years (interquartile range, 25-44 years), and the female:male ratio was 3.9:1. The global seroprevalence of HCV in Bahia was estimated to be 1.3\% (3,230/247,837), corresponding to an infection rate of 21.2/100,000 inhabitants. The seroprevalence of HCV was higher among males and increased with age. The presence of anti-HCV antibodies was detected throughout all mesoregions of Bahia, and the municipality with the highest infection rate was Ipiau (112.04 cases/100,000 inhabitants). Genotypes 1 and 3 were found to be the most prevalent, followed by genotypes 2, 4, and 5. Our results provide evidence of the widespread distribution of previous HCV infection throughout the state of Bahia.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to investigate possible methods to enhance the rate of aerobic biodegradation of hydrocarbons (ex-situ treatments). In this work, the bioremediation processes were applied to a sandy soil with a high level of contamination originated from the leakage of a diesel oil underground storage tank at a petrol station. Laboratory scale experiments (Bartha biometer flasks) were used to evaluate the biodegradation of the diesel oil. Enhancement of biodegradation was carried out through biostimulation (addition of nitrogen and phosphorus solutions or Tween 80 surfactant) and bioaugmentation (bacterial consortium isolated from a landfarming system). To investigate interactions between optimizing factors, and to find the right combination of these agents, the study was based on full factorial experimental design. Efficiency of biodegradation was simultaneously measured by two methods: respirometric (microbial CO2 production) and gas chromatography. Acute toxicity tests with Daphnia similis were applied for examination of the efficiency of the processes in terms of the generation of less toxic products. Results showed that all bioremediation strategies enhanced the natural bioremediation of the contaminated soil and the best results were obtained when treatments had nutritional amendment. Respirometric data indicated a maximum hydrocarbon mineralization of 19.8\%, obtained through the combination of the three agents, with a total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) removal of 45.5\% in 55 days of treatment. At the end of the experiments, two predominant bacteria species were isolated and identified (Staphylococcus hominis and Kocuria palustris).},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the bacterial diversity associated with a corrosive biofilm in a steel pipeline from the Gulf of Mexico used to inject marine water into the oil reservoir. Several aerobic and heterotrophic bacteria were isolated and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Metagenomic DNA was also extracted to perform a denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of ribosomal genes and to construct a 16S rRNA gene metagenomic library. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles and ribosomal libraries exhibited a limited bacterial diversity. Most of the species detected in the ribosomal library or isolated from the pipeline were assigned to Proteobacteria (Halomonas spp., Idiomarina spp., Marinobacter aquaeolei, Thalassospira sp., Silicibacter sp. and Chromohalobacter sp.) and Bacilli (Bacillus spp. and Exiguobacterium spp.). This is the first report that associates some of these bacteria with a corrosive biofilm. It is relevant that no sulfate-reducing bacteria were isolated or detected by a PCR-based method. The diversity and relative abundance of bacteria from water pipeline biofilms may contribute to an understanding of the complexity and mechanisms of metal corrosion during marine water injection in oil secondary recovery. © 2006 Federation of European Microbiological Societies Published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

	abstract = {Plastics are a major constituent of municipal solid waste that pose a growing disposal and environmental pollution problem due to their recalcitrant nature. To reduce their environmental impacts and allow them to be transformed during organic waste recycling processes, various materials have recently been introduced to improve the biodegradability of plastics. These include conventional plastics amended with additives that are meant to enhance their biodegradability, bio-based plastics and natural fiber composites. In this study, the rate and extent of mineralization of a wide range of commercially available plastic alternative materials were determined during composting, anaerobic digestion and soil incubation. The biodegradability was assessed by measuring the amount of carbon mineralized from these materials during incubation under conditions that simulate these three environments and by examination of the materials by scanning electron micrography (SEM). The results showed that during a 660 day soil incubation, substantial mineralization was observed for polyhydroxyalkanoate plastics, starch-based plastics and for materials made from compost. However, only a polyhydroxyalkanoate-based plastic biodegraded at a rate similar to the positive control (cellulose). No significant degradation was observed for polyethylene or polypropylene plastics or the same plastics amended with commercial additives meant to confer biodegradability. During anaerobic digestion for 50 days, 20-25\% of the bio-based materials but less than 2\% of the additive containing plastics were converted to biogas (CH4 + CO2). After 115 days of composting, 0.6\% of an additive amended polypropylene, 50\% of a plastarch material and 12\% of a soy wax permeated paper pulp was converted to carbon dioxide. SEM analysis showed substantial disintegration of polyhydroxyalkanoate- based plastic, some surface changes for other bio-based plastics and coconut coir materials but no evidence of degradation of polypropylene or polypropylene containing additives. Although certain bio-based plastics and natural fibers biodegraded to an appreciable extent in the three environments, only a polyhydroxyalkanoate-based resin biodegraded to significant extents during the time scale of composting and anaerobic digestion processes used for solid waste management. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The mature flavivirus infectious virion has 90 envelope (E) protein homo-dimers that pack tightly to form a smooth protein coat with icosahedral symmetry. Human antibodies that strongly neutralize ZIKV and DENVs recognize complex quaternary structure epitopes displayed on E-homo-dimers and higher order structures. The ZIKV and DENV E protein expressed as a soluble protein is mainly a monomer that does not display quaternary epitopes, which may explain the modest success with soluble recombinant E (sRecE) as a vaccine and diagnostic antigen. New strategies are needed to design recombinant immunogens that display these critical immune targets. Here we present two novel methods for building or stabilizing in vitro E-protein homo-dimers that display quaternary epitopes. In the first approach we immobilize sRecE to enable subsequent dimer generation. As an alternate method, we describe the use of human mAbs to stabilize homo-dimers in solution. The ability to produce recombinant E protein dimers displaying quaternary structure epitopes is an important advance with applications in flavivirus diagnostics and vaccine development.},

The cDNA is 486 bp in length and encodes a protein of 162 amino acids.

Expression of recombinant protein in mammalian cells was only accomplished by eliminating the 5′ and 3′ UTR, replacing the IL15 signal peptide with the tissue plasminogen activator signal peptide, and adding 3′ sequence to disrupt presumptive secondary structure of the mRNA. Biologically active feline IL15 was expressed in HEK293T cells and was shown to sustain primary feline lymphocytes, a feline T cell line, and mouse CTLL-2 cells. Proliferation of CTLL-2 cells was induced by the recombinant protein in a dose-dependent manner.

Using 96 SARS-CoV-2 and 104 non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genomes and our in-house program, GolayMetaMiner, four specific regions longer than 50 nucleotides in the SARS-CoV-2 genome were identified. Primers were designed to target the longest and previously untargeted nsp2 region and optimized as a probe-free real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The new COVID-19-nsp2 assay had a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.8 TCID50 /mL and did not amplify other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory viruses. Assay reproducibility in terms of cycle threshold (Cp) values was satisfactory, with the total imprecision (\% CV) values well below 5\%. Evaluation of the new assay using 59 clinical specimens from 14 confirmed cases showed 100\% concordance with our previously developed COVID-19-RdRp/Hel reference assay. A rapid, sensitive, SARS-CoV-2-specific real-time RT-PCR assay, COVID-19-nsp2, was developed.},

Here, we perform structure and interaction mapping on four DENV and ZIKV strains inside virions and in infected cells. Comparative analysis of SHAPE reactivities across serotypes nominates potentially functional regions that are highly structured, conserved, and contain low synonymous mutation rates. Interaction mapping by SPLASH identifies many pair-wise interactions, 40\% of which form alternative structures, suggesting extensive structural heterogeneity. Analysis of shared interactions between serotypes reveals a conserved macro-organization whereby interactions can be preserved at physical locations beyond sequence identities. We further observe that longer-range interactions are preferentially disrupted inside cells, and show the importance of new interactions in virus fitness. These findings deepen our understanding of Flavivirus genome organization and serve as a resource for designing therapeutics in targeting RNA viruses. Here, the authors provide detailed analyses of viral RNA structure in virions and in infected cells for four dengue virus serotypes and four Zika virus strains, and identify conserved structures that are important for virus replication.},

The cachexia syndrome is a debilitating state of cancer that predominantly results from the loss of skeletal muscle mass, which is in part associated with apoptosis. How tumors promote apoptosis in distally located skeletal muscles has not been explored. Using both tumor cell lines and patient samples, we show that tumor-derived microvesicles induce apoptosis of skeletal muscle cells. This proapoptotic activity is mediated by a microRNA cargo, miR-21, which signals through the Toll-like 7 receptor (TLR7) on murine myoblasts to promote cell death. Furthermore, tumor microvesicles and miR-21 require c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity to regulate this apoptotic response. Together, these results describe a unique pathway by which tumor cells promote muscle loss, which might provide a great insight into elucidating the causes and treatment options of cancer cachexia.},

We obtained 98\% agreement (K = 0.952) by direct comparison. The virtually identical results obtained with these antigens in detecting seroconversion following infection with HEV suggests that they were reacting with antibodies that detect the same or very similar epitopes of HEV. We then tested human and swine serum samples for anti-HEV in EIAs that utilized one or the other of the two ORF2 antigens and showed that these results were also virtually identical. The specimens tested included swine sera from the United States, Canada, China, Korea, and Thailand and sera from veterinarians, U.S. and non-U.S. volunteer blood donors, and U.S. and non-U.S. animal handlers. We tested 792 swine sera and obtained 93\% agreement (κ = 0.839). We similarly tested 882 human sera and obtained 99\% agreement (κ = 0.938). Moreover, we found virtually no difference in the levels of prevalence of anti-HEV as measured by the two tests, again suggesting that the antigens derived from human and swine HEV contain the same immunodominant epitopes.},

Here, we tested the sensitivity and efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 detection in clinical samples collected directly into a mix of lysis buffer and RNA preservative, thus inactivating the virus immediately after sampling. We tested 79 COVID-19 patients and 20 healthy controls. We collected two samples (nasopharyngeal swabs) from each participant: one swab was inserted into a test tube with Viral Transport Medium (VTM), following the standard guideline used as the recommended method for sample collection; the other swab was inserted into a lysis buffer supplemented with nucleic acid stabilization mix (coined NSLB). We found that RT-qPCR tests of patients were significantly more sensitive with NSLB sampling, reaching detection threshold 2.1±0.6 (Mean±SE) PCR cycles earlier then VTM samples from the same patient. We show that this improvement is most likely since NSLB samples are not diluted in lysis buffer before RNA extraction. Re-extracting RNA from NSLB samples after 72 hours at room temperature did not affect the sensitivity of detection, demonstrating that NSLB allows for long periods of sample preservation without special cooling equipment. We also show that swirling the swab in NSLB and discarding it did not reduce sensitivity compared to retaining the swab in the tube, thus allowing improved automation of COVID-19 tests. Overall, we show that using NSLB instead of VTM can improve the sensitivity, safety, and rapidity of COVID-19 tests at a time most needed.},

In this way, we are clearing up the role played by neutral networks of genotypes, by defective and cooperative interactions among viral mutants, or by co-evolution with immune systems. Models of viral evolution are thus improving their accuracy and becoming more competent from a conceptual and a predictive viewpoint.},

Biofilms formed on filter media comprised of bacteria enclosed in a polymeric matrix are responsible for the adsorption of BOM and attachment of planktonic microorganisms. This study investigated the removal of Escherichia coli cells injected into laboratory-scale biofilters and the role of biofilm in retaining the injected E. coli. Green fluorescent protein was used as a specific marker to detect and quantify E. coli in the biofilms. About 35\% of the total injected E. coli cells were observed in the filter effluents, when initial cell concentrations were measured at 7.4 Â 10 6 CFU/mL and 1.6 Â 10 7 CFU/mL in two separate experiments. The results from real-time PCR and plate count analysis indicated that 95\% of the E. coli retained inside the filters were either non-viable or could not be recovered by colony counting techniques. Injected cells were unevenly distributed inside the filter with more than 70\% located at the top 1/5 of the filter. Images obtained from an epifluorescent microscope showed that E. coli cells were embedded inside the biofilm matrix and presented mainly as microcolonies intertwined with other microorganisms, which was consistent with findings from standard plate count methods and qPCR.},

	abstract = {The complexity of fecal microbial communities and overlap among human and other animal sources have made it difficult to identify source-specific fecal indicator bacteria. However, the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies now provides increased sequencing power to resolve microbial community composition within and among environments. These data can be mined for information on source-specific phylotypes and/or assemblages of phylotypes (i.e., microbial signatures). We report the development of a new genetic marker for human fecal contamination identified through microbial pyrotag sequence analysis of the V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Sequence analysis of 37 sewage samples and comparison with database sequences revealed a human-associated phylotype within the Lachnospiraceae family, which was closely related to the genus Blautia. This phylotype, termed Lachno2, was on average the second most abundant fecal bacterial phylotype in sewage influent samples from Milwaukee, WI. We developed a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay for Lachno2 and used it along with the qPCR-based assays for human Bacteroidales (based on the HF183 genetic marker), total Bacteroidales spp., and enterococci and the conventional Escherichia coli and enterococci plate count assays to examine the prevalence of fecal and human fecal pollution in Milwaukee's harbor. Both the conventional fecal indicators and the human-associated indicators revealed chronic fecal pollution in the harbor, with significant increases following heavy rain events and combined sewer overflows. The two human-associated genetic marker abundances were tightly correlated in the harbor, a strong indication they target the same source (i.e., human sewage). Human adenoviruses were routinely detected under all conditions in the harbor, and the probability of their occurrence increased by 154\% for every 10-fold increase in the human indicator concentration. Both Lachno2 and human Bacteroidales increased specificity to detect sewage compared to general indicators, and the relationship to a human pathogen group suggests that the use of these alternative indicators will improve assessments for human health risks in urban waters.},

	abstract = {Keywords: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction Stormwater Fecal indicators Water quality a b s t r a c t Human sewage contamination of surface waters is a major human health concern. We found urban stormwater systems that collect and convey runoff from impervious surfaces act as a conduit for sewage originating from breeches in sanitary sewer infrastructure. A total of 828 samples at 45 stormwater outfalls were collected over a four-year period and assessed by culture based methods, PCR, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) to test for traditional and alternative indicators of fecal pollution. All outfalls had the HF183 (human) Bacteroides genetic marker detected in at least one sample, suggesting sewage contamination is nearly ubiquitous in the urban environment. However, most outfalls were intermittently positive, ranging from detection in 11\%e100\% of the samples. Positive results did not correlate with seasonality, rainfall amounts, or days since previous rainfall. Approximately two-thirds of the outfalls had high ({\textgreater}5000 copy number, i.e. CN, per 100 ml) or moderate levels (1000e5000 CN per 100 ml) of the human Bacteroides genetic marker. Escherichia coli (E. coli) and enterococci levels did not correlate to human Bacteroides. A total of 66\% of all outfall samples had standard fecal indicator levels above 10,000 CFU per 100 ml. A tiered assessment using this benchmark to identify high priority sites would have failed to flag 35\% of the samples that had evidence of sewage contamination. In addition, high fecal indicators would have flagged 33\% of samples as priority that had low or no evidence of sewage. Enteric virus levels in one outfall with high levels of the human Bacteroides genetic marker were similar to untreated wastewater, which illustrates stormwater can serve as a pathway for pathogen contamination. The major source of fecal pollution at four of five river sites that receive stormwater discharge appeared to be from sewage sources rather than non-human sources based on the ratios of human Bacteroides to total Bacteroides spp. This study shows the feasibility and benefits of employing molecular methods to test for alternative indicators of fecal pollution to identify sewage sources and potential health risks and for prioritization of remediation efforts.},

Distinctions between original and modified assays also occurred in analyses of known spike levels of E. faecalis and B. fragilis cells on filters with diverse surface water retentates. Percentages of samples causing PCR failures due to inhibition were lower using the modified assays. The accuracy and precision of spiked bacteria measurements were also generally higher, although mean measurements of both target organisms were still significantly different between systems (p , 0.05). The accuracy and precision of spiked bacteria measurements by both modified assays were further improved using a new sample matrix control spike consisting of cultured Lactococcus lactis cells and a reference assay for this organism. Corrections provided by the L. lactis assay eliminated significant differences in E. faecalis measurements between all three systems and between two of the three systems in B. fragilis measurements.},

Here, we examine the performance of different basecalling tools, looking at accuracy at the level of bases within individual reads and at majority-rule consensus basecalls in an assembly. We also investigate some additional aspects of basecalling: training using a taxon-specific dataset, using a larger neural network model and improving consensus basecalls in an assembly by additional signal-level analysis with Nanopolish. Training basecallers on taxon-specific data results in a significant boost in consensus accuracy, mostly due to the reduction of errors in methylation motifs. A larger neural network is able to improve both read and consensus accuracy, but at a cost to speed. Improving consensus sequences (‘polishing’) with Nanopolish somewhat negates the accuracy differences in basecallers, but pre-polish accuracy does have an effect on post-polish accuracy. Basecalling accuracy has seen significant improvements over the last 2 years. The current version of ONT’s Guppy basecaller performs well overall, with good accuracy and fast performance. If higher accuracy is required, users should consider producing a custom model using a larger neural network and/or training data from the same species.},

	abstract = {Multivariate analyses such as principal component analysis were among the first statistical methods employed to extract information from genetic markers. From their early applications to current innovations, these approaches have proven to be efficient for the analysis of the genetic variability in various contexts such as human genetics, conservation and adaptation studies. However, because multivariate analysis is a wide and diversified area of statistics, choosing a method appropriate to both the data and to the question being asked can be difficult. Moreover, some particularities of genetic markers need to be taken into account when using multivariate methods. As a consequence, multivariate analyses are often used as black boxes, which results in frequent mistakes in the literature. In this review, we provide a critical analysis of the application of multivariate methods to genetic markers, using a general framework that unifies all these methods for the sake of clarity. First, we focus on some common mistakes in these applications and ways to avoid these pitfalls. We then detail the most critical particularities of allele frequencies that demand adaptations of multivariate methods, and we propose solutions to the subsequent problems. Finally, we tackle several questions of interest in which multivariate analysis has a great role to play, such as the study of the typological coherence of different genetic markers, or the investigation of spatial genetic patterns. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

It is thus unclear whether hepatitis E is a neglected disease in Brazil or it has low relevance for public health in this country. Here, for the first time, we report the presence of HEV in Northeast Brazil. A total of 119 swine faecal samples were screened for the presence of HEV RNA using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and further confirmed by conventional RT-PCR; among these, two samples were identified as positive. Molecular evolution analyses based on capsid sequences revealed that the samples had close proximities to HEV sequences belonging to genotype 3 and were genetically related to subtype 3f isolated in humans. Parsimony ancestral states analysis indicated gene flow events from HEV cross-species infection, suggesting an important role of pig hosts in viral spillover. HEV's ability for zoonotic transmission by inter-species host switching as well as its possible adaptation to new animal species remain important issues for human health.},

Recently, newly discovered genotypes HEV-7 and HEV-8 were found to infect camels and possibly humans. Nevertheless, the epidemiological distribution of HEV-7 is not well established. HEV-8 is another newly discovered genotype that was identified in 2016 in Chinese Bactrian camels. Although faecal-oral transmission is the most common route of HEV transmission, HEV can be vertically transmitted from infected mothers to their fetuses. HEV may also spread by zoonotic transmission from infected animals to humans and through person-to-person contact. Nowadays, since the number of reported cases linked to blood donations is increasing annually, HEV is recognized as a transfusion-transmitted virus. Laboratory diagnostic techniques vary in their specificity and sensitivity for HEV detection. Direct techniques allow for detection of the viral proteins, antigens and viral nucleic acid, while HEV-specific IgG and IgM antibodies can help establish a diagnosis in acute and chronic infections. In this review, we will discuss recent technologies in the laboratory diagnosis of HEV, including serological and molecular methods to assess the specificity and sensitivity of currently available HEV commercial assays.},

	abstract = {A novel virus, designated swine hepatitis E virus (swine HEV), was identified in pigs. Swine HEV cross-reacts with antibody to the human HEV capsid antigen. Swine HEV is a ubiquitous agent and the majority of swine ≤3 months of age in herds from the midwestern United States were seropositive. Young pigs naturally infected by swine HEV were clinically normal but had microscopic evidence of hepatitis, and developed viremia prior to seroconversion. The entire ORFs 2 and 3 were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from sera of naturally infected pigs. The putative capsid gene (ORF2) of swine HEV shared about 79-80\% sequence identity at the nucleotide level and 90-92\% identity at the amino acid level with human HEV strains. The small ORF3 of swine HEV had 83-85\% nucleotide sequence identity and 77-82\% amino acid identity with human HEV strains. Phylogenetic analyses showed that swine HEV is closely related to, but distinct from, human HEV strains. The discovery of swine HEV not only has implications for HEV vaccine development, diagnosis, and biology, but also raises a potential public health concern for zoonosis or xenozoonosis following xeno-transplantation with pig organs.},

Eighteen (38\%) of 47 patients with acute non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis were positive for antibody to HEV (anti-HEV), and 9 (50\%) of these were also positive for serum HEV RNA by polymerase chain reaction following reverse transcription. Only 1 (5\%) of the 21 patients with acute hepatitis A was positive for HEV RNA. Travel to endemic areas (mostly to China; odds ratio, 22.2; 95\% confidence interval, 4.7-105.8) and deeper jaundice (odds ratio, 5.2; 95\% confidence interval, 1.01-27.2) were the only factors associated with HEV infection in multivariate analysis. The two HEV isolates from two patients who had traveled to China and the HEV isolate from a patient whose travel history was obscure formed a monophyletic group with the isolates from Guangzhou. The HEV isolates from our patients show a homology of 72\% to 78\% in nucleotide sequence with the Burma, Beijing, India, Pakistan, and Xiangjiang strains; a homology of 81\% to 91\% with the Guangzhou strains; and a homology of 76\% with the Mexico strain. The close relationship between the Taiwan isolates and the Guangzhou strains was further supported by the short Kimura's two-parameter distances among them. In summary, HEV infection does occur in this area. Epidemiological and molecular analyses strongly indicate that most cases of HEV infection originated from travel to HEV-endemic areas.},

The aim of this study was to determine HEV immunoglobulin (Ig)G and RNA prevalence in Catalan blood donors. Study Design and Methods: Nearly 10,000 samples were collected from anonymized, unpaid donors at the Banc de Sang i Teixits (Barcelona, Spain) from June to December 2013. For the serology study, a subset of 1082 donations was tested in parallel for HEV IgG using Wantai and Mikrogen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests. Samples were tested individually (individual-donation nucleic acid test [ID-NAT]) for HEV RNA using the Procleix HEV assay (95\% limit of detection 7.9 IU/mL). Procleix repeat-reactive donations were confirmed by an in-house real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Results: The prevalences of IgG anti-HEV in Catalan blood donors were 19.96\% (Wantai assay) and 10.72\% (Mikrogen assay). Screening of 9998 samples with the Procleix HEV assay yielded three real-time PCR-confirmed and IgM and IgG anti-HEV-positive donations with viral loads of 250, 564, and 2755 IU/mL. The donation with highest viral load was genotype 3f. HEV RNA positivity rate was one per 3333 donations (0.03\%; 95\% confidence interval, 0.01\%-0.09\%). Conclusion: The Procleix HEV ID-NAT screening system has provided evidence of HEV RNA presence in Catalan blood donors. Further data are needed to assess the impact of HEV infection in at-risk patients to design the best strategy to increase blood safety.},

The rapid, reliable, and cost-effective screening of these pathogens is required for the large epidemiological studies. Therefore, a study has been planned to develop a multiplex Reverse Transcriptase-PCR assay which can be used for the screening of maximum number of pathogens at a time. Methodology: To develop multiplex Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay for simultaneous detection of HBV, HCV, and HEV; the serum samples of 54 patients who were positive either singly or in co-infection with for HBV, HCV, and HEV serologically were screened by uniplex PCR/RT-PCR followed by multiplex RT-PCR for HBV, HCV, and HEV using specific primers. These primers can detect most genotypes of these viruses. Multiplex RT-PCR was done in one tube for the identification of viral DNA/RNA using a mixture of three pairs of specific primers for hepatitis B, C, and E viruses. Representative positive samples of these viruses by uniplex/multiplex RT-PCR were also confirmed by sequencing followed by alignment with reference strains sequence. Results: The specificity of multiplex PCR was 100\% with high sensitivity 89\%, 87\%, and 74\% for HBV, HCV, and HEV respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of RT-multiplex PCR demonstrated a good correlation with that of uniplex PCR. Conclusion: The study suggests that multiplex RT-PCR can serve as a simple and reliable assay for rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective method for simultaneous detection of super-infections with HEV particularly in Asian countries as a cause of decompensation of chronic liver disease.},

Large waterborne HEV epidemics have been documented exclusively in developing countries. At least four major genotypes of HEV have been reported worldwide: genotype 1 (found primarily in Asian countries), genotype 2 (isolated from a single outbreak in Mexico), genotype 3 (identified in swine and humans in the United States and many other countries), and genotype 4 (identified in humans, swine and other animals in Asia). To better detect and quantitate different HEV strains that may be present in clinical and environmental samples, we developed a rapid and sensitive real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of HEV RNA. Primers and probes for the real-time RT-PCR were selected based on the multiple sequence alignments of 27 sequences of the ORF3 region. Thirteen HEV isolates representing genotypes 1-4 were used to standardize the real-time RT-PCR assay. The TaqMan® assay detected as few as four genome equivalent (GE) copies of HEV plasmid DNA and detected as low as 0.12 50\% pig infectious dose (PID50) of swine HEV. Different concentrations of swine HEV (120-1.2 PID50) spiked into a surface water concentrate were detected in the real-time RT-PCR assay.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS
A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) upstream of the IL28B gene has been associated with response of patients with chronic hepatitis C to therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin and also with spontaneous clearance of acute hepatitis C in a heterogeneous population. We analyzed the association between IL28B and the clinical presentation of acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in a homogeneous population. 

METHODS
We analyzed the SNP rs12979860 in 190 women from the German anti-D cohort (infected with HCV genotype 1b via contaminated rhesus prophylaxis) and its association with spontaneous clearance. Clinical data were available in 136 women with acute infection who were also evaluated for IL28B genotype. Based on results of a TaqMan polymerase chain reaction assay, the rs12979860 SNP genotypes studied were C/C, C/T, or T/T. 

RESULTS
Spontaneous clearance was more common in patients with the C/C genotype (43/67; 64\%) compared with C/T (22/90; 24\%) or T/T (2/33; 6\%) (P {\textless} .001). Jaundice during acute infection was more common among patients with C/C genotype (32.7\%) than non-C/C patients (with C/T or T/T) (16.1\%; P = .032). In C/C patients, jaundice during acute infection was not associated with an increased chance of spontaneous clearance (56.3\%) compared with those without jaundice (60.6\%). In contrast, in non-C/C patients, jaundice was associated with a higher likelihood of spontaneous clearance (42.9\%) compared with those without jaundice (13.7\%). 

CONCLUSIONS
The SNP rs12979860 upstream of IL28B is associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV. Women with the C/T or T/T genotype who did not develop jaundice had a lower chance of spontaneous clearance of HCV infection.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Introduced in 2013-2014, the second- and third-wave directly acting antivirals (DAAs) have strongly enhanced the efficacy and tolerability of anti-HCV treatment, with a sustained virological response (SVR) in 90-95\% of cases treated. The aim of this paper was to focus on the type and prevalence of viral strains with a reduced sensitivity to DAAs and on treatment choices for DAA-experienced patients. METHODS The Medline was searched for "HCV infection", "HCV treatment", "Directly acting antivirals","HCV resistance". RESULTS Most patients who did not achieve an SVR have been found to be infected with HCV mutant strains with a reduced susceptibility to these drugs. These mutants occur frequently in the NS5A region, with a moderate frequency in the NS3/4A regions and rarely in the NS5B region. Treatment-induced mutants resistant to NS5A DAAs persist for years after treatment discontinuation, whereas those resistant to the NS3 DAAs have a shorter duration. CONCLUSIONS Patients who have failed HCV treatment with DAA agents have several re-treatment options, but re-treatment selection may be intricate and resistance testing is recommended to optimize this choice. It is, therefore, important to bear in mind that the correct determination of HCV genotype and subtype and the identification of RASs are essential elements for choosing the optimal re-treatment. It is supposed that it is useful to give readers some other suggestions regarding therapeutic reprocessing.},

	abstract = {Hemophilia A is a rare bleeding disorder treated with numerous factor VIII (FVIII)-containing replacement concentrates. This treatment approach has led to the formation of alloantibodies that neutralize the FVIII activity (inhibitors) conveyed by these commercially available concentrates in {\textasciitilde} 25\% of patients with severe hemophilia A (FVIII activity {\textless} 1\% of normal). This phenomenon significantly complicates the treatment of these patients and compromises the effectiveness and efficiency of these products to reverse or prevent bleeding complications. Studying the population with alloantibody inhibitors is imperative but difficult due to the overall small number of individuals affected and the heterogeneity within this limited group. Furthermore, few randomized clinical trials have been conducted to answer pertinent questions so many controversies persist. This article focuses on the conflicting data on the variables associated with alloantibody FVIII inhibitor development with a particular emphasis on age and intensity of first treatment, the role of primary prophylaxis regimens in modulating this phenomenon, and the degree of purity of FVIII product as a potential contributing risk factor. The optimal dosing regimen and type of FVIII replacement product that should be used to achieve the highest success rate in immune tolerance induction (ITI) protocols are also discussed, as well as whether the addition of immunomodulatory agents, especially rituximab, to ITI regimens enhances the durability of ITI and the eradication of alloantibody FVIII inhibitors.},

Methods A total of 711 subjects from West Mexico (181 Amerindians and 530 Mestizos) were studied for the prevalence of IL28B (rs12979860C/T, rs8099917G/T) and IFNL4 (rs368234815ΔG/TT) genotypes. A case-control study was performed in 234 treatment-naïve HCV Mestizos (149 chronic hepatitis C and 85 with SC) for the association of haplotypes with SC and liver damage. A real-time PCR assay was used for genotyping, and transitional elastography staged liver damage. Results Significant Fst-values indicated differentiation between the studied populations.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Training health providers is a strategy for improving health care quality that need to be technically correct and comply with the conceptual universe of the trainees. A pilot study was carried out to explore the consistency of knowledge on blood transmission of viral hepatitis among primary care providers. METHODS: A non-identified questionnaire was applied to 190 providers attending a public health training program in 2003 and 2004. Answers were compared according to two groups: physicians, nurses and dentists (115 subjects) and other health providers (66 subjects). Frequencies of correct and incorrect answers were compared through Chi-square test (χ 2). Nine respondents did not inform their occupation. RESULTS: The study population mainly comprised women (80\%) aged 20 to 60 years from Northeastern (27.4\%), Southeastern (35.3\%), and Midwestern (37.3\%) regions. Blood transfusion was associated with hepatitis B and C for 57.5\% of the respondents; hemophilia was associated with hepatitis B and C for 55.7\% of the respondents, while 74\% considered to be incorrect the statement: "viral hepatitis cannot be transmitted through blood" and 16.4\% considered it correct. The number of correct answers regarding blood transfusion was greater in the group of physicians, nurses and dentists than other providers (χ 2 =1.2; p=0.2741). CONCLUSIONS: These findings were compared with current data on viral hepatitis transmission and the consistency of the answers concerning different risk factors was evaluated. These providers' knowledge on blood transmission of these conditions shows inconsistencies that may jeopardize the effectiveness of prevention and control programs.},

We show that the human genome can be parsed objectively into haplotype blocks: sizable regions over which there is little evidence for historical recombination and within which only a few common haplotypes are observed. The boundaries of blocks and specific haplotypes they contain are highly correlated across populations. We demonstrate that such haplotype frameworks provide substantial statistical power in association studies of common genetic variation across each region.

	abstract = {{\textbar} The IL28B locus attracted the attention of HCV researchers after a series of genome-wide association studies independently identified a strong association between common IL28B polymorphisms and the outcome of PEG-IFN-α plus ribavirin combination therapy in patients chronically infected with HCV genotype 1. This association was subsequently replicated for other HCV genotypes and has been linked to spontaneous eradication of HCV, development of steatosis and biochemical changes (such as altered levels of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and LDL). Despite the introduction of direct-acting antiviral drugs, IL28B genetics are likely to play a part in patient selection and treatment decisions-moving towards a personalized approach to therapy. In HCV-infected patients with the so-called favourable IL28B genotype (rs12979860 CC; associated with better treatment response), hepatic expression levels of IL28B and interferon-stimulated genes seem to be reduced at baseline, but are induced more strongly after IFN-α administration, perhaps resulting in more effective elimination of the virus. Clarification of the mechanisms underlying these biological phenomena will lead to improved understanding of the antiviral effects of IFN-λ and, ideally, to the development of better therapies against HCV infection. This Review summarizes current understanding of the role of IL28B in HCV infection and response to therapy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS Hepatitis C virus (HCV) induces chronic infection in 50\% to 80\% of infected persons; approximately 50\% of these do not respond to therapy. We performed a genome-wide association study to screen for host genetic determinants of HCV persistence and response to therapy. METHODS The analysis included 1362 individuals: 1015 with chronic hepatitis C and 347 who spontaneously cleared the virus (448 were coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]). Responses to pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin were assessed in 465 individuals. Associations between more than 500,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and outcomes were assessed by multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS Chronic hepatitis C was associated with SNPs in the IL28B locus, which encodes the antiviral cytokine interferon lambda. The rs8099917 minor allele was associated with progression to chronic HCV infection (odds ratio [OR], 2.31; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.74-3.06; P = 6.07 x 10(-9)). The association was observed in HCV mono-infected (OR, 2.49; 95\% CI, 1.64-3.79; P = 1.96 x 10(-5)) and HCV/HIV coinfected individuals (OR, 2.16; 95\% CI, 1.47-3.18; P = 8.24 x 10(-5)). rs8099917 was also associated with failure to respond to therapy (OR, 5.19; 95\% CI, 2.90-9.30; P = 3.11 x 10(-8)), with the strongest effects in patients with HCV genotype 1 or 4. This risk allele was identified in 24\% of individuals with spontaneous HCV clearance, 32\% of chronically infected patients who responded to therapy, and 58\% who did not respond (P = 3.2 x 10(-10)). Resequencing of IL28B identified distinct haplotypes that were associated with the clinical phenotype. CONCLUSIONS The association of the IL28B locus with natural and treatment-associated control of HCV indicates the importance of innate immunity and interferon lambda in the pathogenesis of HCV infection.},

	abstract = {Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the IL28B gene were identified as major predictors of treatment response (sustained virologic response-SVR) and spontaneous clearance of HCV. Haemophilia patients have the highest prevalence of HCV, and are a unique target for genetic studies. The Israeli population is ethnically heterogeneous; therefore, genetic variability is anticipated. To determine the IL28B haplotypes in HCV-infected haemophilia patients and association with SVR and spontaneous viral clearance. IL28B polymorphism at SNPs rs12979860 and rs8099917 was determined in sera obtained from 130 HCV-infected haemophilia patients. The frequency of the various haplotypes was analysed according to treatment response, spontaneous HCV clearance, viral load and degree of fibrosis. The CC haplotype at SNP rs12979860 was found in 31\% of patients, whereas the TT genotype at SNP rs8099917 was detected in 57\% of cases. SVR was achieved in 70\% of patients carrying the CC haplotype (P = 0.0196 vs. CT/TT), and 50\% of the TT genotype at SNP rs8099917 (P = 0.0227 vs. TG/GG). Thirty-five percent of patients carrying the CC haplotype and 26\% with the TT genotype at SNP rs8099917 showed spontaneous clearance of HCV infection (P = 0.00262 vs. CT/TT; and P = 0.00371 vs. TG/GG respectively). The C-allele frequency was exceptionally high (71\%) in immigrants from the Asian republics of Russia. In HCV-infected haemophilia patients, SVR was more commonly achieved among patients who had the CC (rs12979860) or TT (rs8099917) genotype. Likewise, patients who possess harbour the CC or TT genotypes were more likely to clear HCV infection spontaneously. A unique distribution of the CC genotype was observed in some ethnic groups.},

	abstract = {The IL28B locus attracted the attention of HCV researchers after a series of genome-wide association studies independently identified a strong association between common IL28B polymorphisms and the outcome of PEG-IFN-α plus ribavirin combination therapy in patients chronically infected with HCV genotype 1. This association was subsequently replicated for other HCV genotypes and has been linked to spontaneous eradication of HCV, development of steatosis and biochemical changes (such as altered levels of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and LDL). Despite the introduction of direct-acting antiviral drugs, IL28B genetics are likely to play a part in patient selection and treatment decisions-moving towards a personalized approach to therapy. In HCV-infected patients with the so-called favourable IL28B genotype (rs12979860 CC; associated with better treatment response), hepatic expression levels of IL28B and interferon-stimulated genes seem to be reduced at baseline, but are induced more strongly after IFN-α administration, perhaps resulting in more effective elimination of the virus. Clarification of the mechanisms underlying these biological phenomena will lead to improved understanding of the antiviral effects of IFN-λ and, ideally, to the development of better therapies against HCV infection. This Review summarizes current understanding of the role of IL28B in HCV infection and response to therapy.},

This regimen for 12 weeks is highly effective for genotype 2, whereas genotype 3 has proven to be more challenging and requires 24 weeks of therapy.

They have often been accompanied by demonstrations that when a disease is common the prevalence ratio and the prevalence odds ratio may differ substantially. However, this does not tell us which measure is the more valid to use. In fact, the prevalence odds ratio a) estimates the incidence rate ratio with fewer assumptions than are required for the prevalence ratio; b) can be estimated using the same methods as for the odds ratio in case-control studies, namely, the Mantel-Haenszel method and logistic regression; and c) provides practical, analytical, and theoretical consistency between analyses of a prevalence study and prevalence case-control analyses based on the same study population. For these reasons, the prevalence odds ratio will continue to be one of the standard methods for analyzing prevalence studies and prevalence case-control studies.},

Once treatment of chronic HBV is initiated with approved anti-hepadnaviral agents, such as lamivudine, interferon-alpha, or adefovir dipivoxil, the measurement of HBV DNA in serum can not only help monitor treatment efficacy but also indicates breakthrough infection should drug resistance emerge. Advances in the molecular diagnosis of drug resistance using highly sensitive methodologies such as DNA hybridization assays can further pinpoint the type of mutation responsible and, more importantly, detect upcoming viral resistance at an early stage when the variant represents only a minor fraction of the total viral population. Such new tools are especially relevant for patients at high risk for disease progression or acute exacerbation. Recent diagnostic developments including HBV genotyping and precore/core promoter assays that could well play important future roles in HBV patient management are also reviewed.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a human DNA virus, which replicates through an RNA intermediate because of the reverse-transcriptase (RT) activity of its DNA polymerase. As a result, the mutation rate for HBV is higher than the rate observed for most DNA viruses. HBVs are classified into genotypes based on genomic sequencing, and antigenic subtypes based on the antigenic properties of its major surface glycoprotein, the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). Subgenotypes have been identified within most of the HBV genotypes. The HBV groups defined by the different genotype-HBsAg subtype associations found over the world display characteristic geographical distributions, reflecting the movements of human populations and other epidemiologically significant events. Such HBV groups constitute genetically stable viral populations sharing a common evolutionary history, but additional stable changes, originating from mutation and mutant selection, are observed within all of them. These viral sub-populations are known as the HBV variants, and some of which have medical and public health relevance. Pre-core (pre-C) defective variants have been shown to make HBV infection much less susceptible to interferon treatment, and treatment failures with other antiviral drugs have been associated with selection of resistant variants that display specific mutations in the genome region encoding the viral RT activity. Since the RT region of the genome overlaps the sequence encoding the HBsAg molecule, selection of drug resistant variants involves, in some cases, the indirect selection of HBsAg variants. Viral variants displaying changes in HBsAg seem to be very common among chronic HBV carriers; and some of these variants may emerge under the pressure of the neutralizing antibody response, leading to vaccine resistance and resistance to immunotherapy. Mutations conferring resistance to immunotherapy are noted often among liver transplant recipients and among babies born to HBV-carrier mothers. In addition, some of these HBsAg variants have been associated with lack of detection by HBsAg tests used for the diagnosis of HBV infection, for the identification of chronic carriers, for screening of blood donations for transfusion, and in the manufacture of therapeutic blood products.},

	abstract = {Since its discovery in 1989, hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been intensively investigated to understand its biology and develop effective antiviral therapies. The efforts of the previous 25 years have resulted in a better understanding of the virus, and this was facilitated by the development of in vitro cell culture systems for HCV replication. Antiviral treatments and sustained virological responses have also improved from the early interferon monotherapy to the current all-oral regimens using direct-acting antivirals. However, antiviral resistance has become a critical issue in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, similar to other chronic viral infections, and retreatment options following treatment failure have become important questions. Despite the clinical challenges in the management of chronic hepatitis C, substantial progress has been made in understanding HCV, which may facilitate the investigation of other closely related flaviviruses and lead to the development of antiviral agents against these human pathogens.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C chronic liver disease is a major cause of liver transplant in developed countries. This article reports the first nationwide population-based survey conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of HCV antibodies and associated risk factors in the urban population of Brazil.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: The cross sectional study was conducted in all Brazilian macro-regions from 2005 to 2009, as a stratified multistage cluster sample of 19,503 inhabitants aged between 10 and 69 years, representing individuals living in all 26 State capitals and the Federal District. Hepatitis C antibodies were detected by a third-generation enzyme immunoassay. Seropositive individuals were retested by Polymerase Chain Reaction and genotyped. Adjusted prevalence was estimated by macro-regions. Potential risk factors associated with HCV infection were assessed by calculating the crude and adjusted odds ratios, 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) and p values. Population attributable risk was estimated for multiple factors using a case-control approach.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: The overall weighted prevalence of hepatitis C antibodies was 1.38\% (95\% CI: 1.12\%-1.64\%). Prevalence of infection increased in older groups but was similar for both sexes. The multivariate model showed the following to be predictors of HCV infection: age, injected drug use (OR = 6.65), sniffed drug use (OR = 2.59), hospitalization (OR = 1.90), groups socially deprived by the lack of sewage disposal (OR = 2.53), and injection with glass syringe (OR = 1.52, with a borderline p value). The genotypes 1 (subtypes 1a, 1b), 2b and 3a were identified. The estimated population attributable risk for the ensemble of risk factors was 40\%. Approximately 1.3 million individuals would be expected to be anti-HCV-positive in the country.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: The large estimated absolute numbers of infected individuals reveals the burden of the disease in the near future, giving rise to costs for the health care system and society at large. The known risk factors explain less than 50\% of the infected cases, limiting the prevention strategies. Our findings regarding risk behaviors associated with HCV infection showed that there is still room for improving strategies for reducing transmission among drug users and nosocomial infection, as well as a need for specific prevention and control strategies targeting individuals living in poverty.},

	abstract = {Human parasites are often distributed in metapopulations, which makes random sampling for genetic epidemiology difficult. The typical approach to sampling Schistosoma mansoni involves laboratory passage to obtain individual worms with small sample size and selection bias as a consequence. By contrast, the naturally pooled samples from egg output in stool or urine directly represent the genetic composition of current populations. To test whether pooled samples could be used to estimate population allele frequencies, DNA from individual cloned parasites was pooled and amplified by PCR for 7 microsatellites. By polyacrylamide gel analysis, the relative band intensities of the products from the major alleles in the pooled samples differed by 0–6\% from the summed intensities of the individual clones (mean=2·1\%±2·1\% S . D .). The number of PCR cycles (25–40) did not influence the accuracy of the estimate. Varying the frequency of 1 allele in pooled samples from 32 to 69\% likewise did not affect accuracy. Allele frequency estimates from aggregate samples such as eggs will be a better foundation for studies of parasite population dynamics as well as the basis for large-scale association studies of host and parasite characteristics.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis E is endemic in many developing countries where it causes substantial morbidity. In industrialised countries, it is considered rare, and largely confined to travellers returning from endemic areas. However, there is now a growing body of evidence that challenges this notion. Autochthonous hepatitis E in developed countries is far more common than previously recognised, and might be more common than hepatitis A. Hepatitis E has a predilection for older men in whom it causes substantial morbidity and mortality. The disease has a poor prognosis in the context of pre-existing chronic liver disease, and is frequently misdiagnosed as drug-induced liver injury. The source and route of infection remain uncertain, but it might be a porcine zoonosis. Patients with unexplained hepatitis should be tested for hepatitis E, whatever their age or travel history. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	doi = {10.1093/molbev/msl080},
	abstract = {We have characterized the relationship between accurate phylogenetic reconstruction and sequence similarity, testing whether high levels of sequence similarity can consistently produce accurate evolutionary trees. We generated protein families with known phylogenies using a modified version of the PAML/EVOLVER program that produces insertions and deletions as well as substitutions. Protein families were evolved over a range of 100-400 point accepted mutations; at these distances 63\% of the families shared significant sequence similarity. Protein families were evolved using balanced and unbalanced trees, with ancient or recent radiations. In families sharing statistically significant similarity, about 60\% of multiple sequence alignments were 95\% identical to true alignments. To compare recovered topologies with true topol-ogies, we used a score that reflects the fraction of clades that were correctly clustered. As expected, the accuracy of the phylogenies was greatest in the least divergent families. About 88\% of phylogenies clustered over 80\% of clades in families that shared significant sequence similarity, using Bayesian, parsimony, distance, and maximum likelihood methods. However , for protein families with short ancient branches (ancient radiation), only 30\% of the most divergent (but statistically significant) families produced accurate phylogenies, and only about 70\% of the second most highly conserved families, with median expectation values better than 10 ÿ60 , produced accurate trees. These values represent upper bounds on expected tree accuracy for sequences with a simple divergence history; proteins from 700 Giardia families, with a similar range of sequence similarities but considerably more gaps, produced much less accurate trees. For our simulated insertions and deletions, correct multiple sequence alignments did not perform much better than those produced by T-COFFEE, and including sequences with expressed sequence tag-like sequencing errors did not significantly decrease phylogenetic accuracy. In general, although less-divergent sequence families produce more accurate trees, the likelihood of estimating an accurate tree is most dependent on whether radiation in the family was ancient or recent. Accuracy can be improved by combining genes from the same organism when creating species trees or by selecting protein families with the best boot-strap values in comprehensive studies.},

We have tested 75 patients with hemophilia A or B and there were used enzyme immunoassay test-Elisa method for the following: anti-HCV HBsAg, HIV and TPHA.The serological data showed that HCV infection was positive in 29 cases or 38,7\%, whereas infection with HBV and HIV were present in a smaller percentage of the patients (2,7\% HBV and 1,4\% for HIV). HCV infection was present only in 9,5\% of the cases of the age group under 18 years. Infected hemophiliacs with one or two infective agents were found in 34,7\%, respectively 4\%. Infection with T. pallidum was present at none of the examined patients with hemophilia. HCV infection was higher in severe forms of hemophilia B (44,4\%), compared with severe form of hemophilia A (30\%).Based on our results, despite the infrequent application of FVIII and FIX concentrates, and other anti hemophilic preparations used in treating hemophilia patients, the number of infected hemophiliacs with blood-transmittable infectious agents was substantially high, especially with hepatitis C virus.},

	abstract = {Background - Studies on hepatitis C virus kinetics showed that serum levels of interferon fall 48 h after drug administration, when viral load is increasing again. Previously to the availability of pegylated interferon, daily induction therapy with standard interferon was under evaluation. Aims - To evaluate the safety and efficacy of interferon alpha daily induction regimen in combination with ribavirin. Patients and methods - A randomized trial including 93 patients with chronic hepatitis C was carried out. On satisfying all eligibility criteria, patients were randomly allocated to two different treatment groups: 44 individuals in treatment arm A: IFN 3 MU thrice weekly + ribavirin 1.0-1.2 g daily for 48 weeks (IFN TIW) and 49 individuals in treatment arm B: IFN 3 MU daily + ribavirin 1.0-1.2 g daily for 12 weeks followed by IFN 3 MU thrice weekly + ribavirin 1.0-1.2 g daily, until completion of 48 weeks of therapy (IFN QD). HCV genotyping was obtained in 85 subjects. A negative HCV-RNA 6 months after cessation of therapy was considered a sustained virological response. Results - Eighty three patients completed treatment, five dropped out (one from IFN TIW and four from IFN QD) and in five patients therapy was discontinued due to medical request (two from IFN TIW and three from IFN QD). There was no statistically significant difference between groups with respect to therapy interruption. The frequency of cirrhosis was 29\%, similar in both groups. In the "intention to treat" analysis the overall sustained virological response was 39.8\%. There was no significant difference in sustained virological response rate between both treatment strategies (36.4\% IFN TIW vs 42.9\% IFN QD). In the 83 patients who finished the trial, sustained virological response was 44.6\%. Among subjects with HCV genotype-1, the sustained virological response was 42\% (40.9\% IFN TIW vs 42.9\% IFN QD) and among patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3, the sustained virological response was 55.6\% (50\% IFN TIW vs 63.6\% IFN QD). Conclusions - Combination therapy had an overall sustained virological response rate of 39.8\% ("intention to treat analysis"). There was no difference with respect to sustained virological response rates between patients who used daily induction schedule compared to standard regimen. Adverse events, even more frequent in the daily induction group, did not interfere with the treatment strategies.},

The pattern of urbanization is not uniform so that within the same city the rates and sources of population increase vary. Here we report on the parasite composition in one neighborhood in the metropolitan area of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. Using epidemiological data and population genetics we find evidence for local transmission and maintenance of Schistosoma mansoni infection within an urban population and little contribution from rural-urban migration.

	abstract = {Many parasite populations are difficult to sample because they are not uniformly distributed between several host species and are often not easily collected from the living host, thereby limiting sample size and possibly distorting the representation of the population. For the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, we investigated the use of eggs, in aggregate, from the stools of infected individuals as a simple and representative sample. Previously, we demonstrated that microsatellite allele frequencies can be accurately estimated from pooled DNA of cloned S. mansoni adults. Here, we show that genotyping of parasite populations from reproductively isolated laboratory strains can be used to identify these specific populations based on characteristic patterns of allele frequencies, as observed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and automated sequencer analysis of fluorescently labeled PCR products. Microsatellites used to genotype aggregates of eggs collected from stools of infected individuals produced results consistent with the geographic distribution of the samples. Preferential amplification of smaller alleles, and stutter PCR products, had negligible effect on measurement of genetic differentiation. Direct analysis of total stool eggs can be an important approach to questions of population genetics for this parasite by increasing the sample size to thousands per infected individual and by reducing bias.},

	abstract = {All Schistosoma mansoni tri- and tetranucleotide repeat microsatellites published as of December 2018 were identified. All 52 were evaluated for autosomal location, strength of amplification, scorability and behavior as single-copy loci by polyacrylamide and capillary gel electrophoresis. Of these, 27 were unique, autosomal, polymorphic, easily scored and single copy as assessed on pooled adult worm DNA from two different continental origins and adult worm clones. These microsatellites were distributed across all seven autosomal chromosomes. On laboratory strains their heterozygosity ranged from 0.22 to 0.77. Individual markers had 5-13 alleles, allelic richness of 2-10 and an effective allele number of 1.3-8.14. Those infected by Schistosoma mansoni carry many genetically distinct, sexually reproducing parasites, therefore, for an individual infection the complete allele frequency profile of their progeny consists of a pool of DNA from multiple diploid eggs. Using a set of 25 microsatellites, we calculated allele frequency profiles of eggs in fecal samples from people in two Brazilian communities separated by 6 km: Jenipapo (n = 80) and Volta do Rio (n = 38). There were no a priori characteristics that could predict the performance of markers in natural infections based on their performance with laboratory strains. Increasing marker number did not change accuracy for differentiation and diversity but did improve precision. Our data suggest that using a random set of 10-20 microsatellites appears to result in values that exhibit low standard deviations for diversity and differentiation indices. All identified microsatellites as well as PCR conditions, allele size, primer sequences and references for all tri- and tetramer microsatellites markers presented in this work are available at: https://sites.google.com/case.edu/cwru-and-fiocruz-wdrc/home.},

Selection for resistance occurs primarily within the gut of humans and animals as well as in the environment through natural resistance and residual antibiotics in streams and soil. We evaluated antimicrobial resistance in Gram negative bacteria from a river system in a rural community in Bahia, Brazil. Water was collected from the Jiquiriçá and Brejões rivers and the piped water supply. Additionally, stools were collected from a random sample of residents, cows, pigs and horses near the river. The samples were screened for bacteria resistant to ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime, and meropenem and identified biochemically at the genus and species levels. Microbial source tracking demonstrated that ruminant and human fecal contamination increased as the rivers neared the village center and decreased after the last residence. Antibiotic bacteria were identified from all samples (n = 32). No bacteria were resistant to carbapenems, but the majority of the enterobacteria were resistant to ciprofloxacin, even though this class of antibiotics is not commonly used in food animals in this region. Considering these facts, together with the pattern of human fecal contamination, a human source was considered most likely for these resistant isolates.},

	abstract = {Introduction. Giardia duodenalis is an intestinal protozoan with a high prevalence in children of developing countries. Molecular studies revealed a great genetic diversity of G. duodenalis, with assemblages A and B found mainly in humans. Despite its importance, the information on the molecular epidemiology of human giardiasis is still limited in Brazil.Objective. To characterize G. duodenalis molecular isolates in children from Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.Materials and methods. Giardia duodenalis positive fecal samples were obtained from 71 children from two day care centers and 39 users of a clinical analysis laboratory. Samples were analyzed by PCR-RFLP of the glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) and beta-giardin genes and by the sequencing of beta-giardin.Results. Of the 110 G. duodenalis samples, 80 (72.7\%) amplified one or both target genes. Of these, 62 (77.5 \%) were identified as assemblage A and 18 (22.5\%) as assemblage B. The subassemblage AII was identified in 58.8\% (n=47) of isolates followed by the sub-assemblage AI (18.8\%, n=15), BIV (11.2\%, n=9), and BIII (5.0\%, n=4). The AII sub-assemblage was the most frequent in children of both day care centers whereas AI was found only in the group attended at the clinical laboratory. Sub-assemblage AII predominated in children under two years.Conclusions. The higher frequency of AII sub-assemblage suggests that anthroponotic transmission is more common in Salvador, but that zoonotic transmission pathways are also present and a change in susceptibility to different molecular patterns of Giardia may occur during child growth.},

The study area was chosen in the States of Acre and Rondonia where most cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV)/HDV are reported. From December 2003 to October 2004, 40 HBsAg carriers with anti-HDV IgM were selected. An epidemiologic questionnaire, including demographic and clinical/epidemiologic variables was filled out. HDV amplification and genotyping were performed. Genotype I was detected in 22 patients (55.0\%), whereas genotype III was identified in 18 (45.0\%). Patients who were infected with genotype I were older (45.1 ?? 17.8 years) than patients infected with genotype III (32.8 ?? 10.9 years; P = 0.01). No symptoms were reported by 21 (52.5\%) patients. Otherwise, 19 (47.5\%) had symptoms (fatigue, abdominal pain, weight loss, and decompensated liver disease) that motivated them to seek medical care. Genotype III carriers were more symptomatic, but no statistical significance was achieved. Our preliminary results show that HDV genotypes I and III are present in Brazilian Amazonia and that HDV genotype III is not limited to the Amerindian population.

Objective: To determine the seroprevalence of hepatitis E in untreated carriers of hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, autoimmune hepatitis and in patients with drug-induced liver disease. Materials and Methods: This is a cross-sectional study with a total sample of 301 outpatient hepatology volunteers. The detection of anti-HEV IgM and IgG antibodies was determined using the ELISA (RecomWell anti-HEV IgG and IgM, Mikrogen®, Germany), One-step real-time PCR was used for the detection of HEV-RNA (Taqman, Life Technologies TM, Foster City, CA, USA). Results: The overall prevalence of anti-HEV IgG and IgM in the population studied was 12.95\% and 2.3\%, respectively. The prevalence by group were: anti-HEV IgG: hepatitis C virus with 13.2\%, hepatitis B virus with 13\%, autoimmune hepatitis with 8.1 and drug-induced liver disease with 21.1. Patients with HCV chronic hepatitis and positive HCV IgG serology showed an increase in transaminase levels in 66.7\% (10/15) of the cases, while in the seronegative patients this increase was present in 42.4\% (42/99) of the cases (p{\textless}0.05). Conclusions: A high seroprevalence of HEV was observed. Among the patients with serology concomitantly positive for anti HEV IgG and IgM, 57.1\% (4/7) had higher levels of TGO and TGP, suggesting acute HEV infection. A relationship between hepatitis C and E virus co-infection and elevated transaminase levels has been demonstrated. Future studies with evaluation of several clinical parameters are necessary.},

	abstract = {Background. Schistosomiasis (Schistosoma mansoni) is classically described as a rural disease that occurs in areas with poor sanitary conditions. This cross-sectional study was undertaken in a suburban area of a large industrialized city in Brazil (Belo Horizonte), aiming at examining epidemiological characteristics of schistosomiasis in an urban setting. Methods. A simple random sample of 658/1896 dwellings was selected and 3049/3290 (92.7\%) residents were submitted to stool examination. Of 518 eligible infected cases and 518 uninfected controls, 87.1\% and 89.8\% participated in the study, respectively. Results. The prevalence of S. mansoni infection was 20\%, predominantly low egg counts in stools; no cases of splenomegaly were found. Signs and symptoms associated with infection were bloody stools (odds ratio [OR] = 8.0) and hardened palpable liver at the middle clavicular and at the middle sternal line (OR = 5.5 and 8.0, respectively). Sociodemographic variables and water contacts predictive of infection were age (10-19 and ≤ 20 yrs; OR = 7.1 and 3.3, respectively), gender (male; OR = 3.1), contacts for swimming and/or playing (twice a month or less and more than twice a month; OR = 2.2 and 3.0, respectively) and residence in Belo Horizonte (born in the City; OR = 2.5). Ninety per cent of dwellings had a piped water supply; no association between water supply and infection was found. Conclusion. Our results emphasize the need for schistosomiasis control measures focusing on water contacts for leisure purposes in this industrialized urban area.},

	abstract = {Acute cases of schistosomiasis have been found on the coastal area of Pernambuco, Brazil, due to environmental disturbances and disorderly occupation of the urban areas. This study identifies and spatially marks the main foci of the snail host species, Biomphalaria glabrata on Itamaracá Island. The chaotic occupation of the beach resorts has favoured the emergence of transmission foci, thus exposing residents and tourists to the risk of infection. A database covering five years of epidemiological investigation on snails infected by Schistosoma mansoni in the island was produced with information from the geographic positioning of the foci, number of snails collected, number of snails tested positive, and their infection rate. The spatial position of the foci were recorded through the Global Positioning System (GPS), and the geographical coordinates were imported by AutoCad. The software packages ArcView and Spring were used for data processing and spatial analysis. AutoCad 2000 was used to plot the pairs of coordinates obtained from GPS. Between 1998 and 2002 5009 snails, of which 12.2\% were positive for S. mansoni, were collected in Forte Beach. A total of 27 foci and areas of environmental risk were identified and spatially analyzed allowing the identification of the areas exposed to varying degrees of risk.},

	abstract = {It is time to raise global awareness to the possibility of schistosomiasis elimination and to support endemic countries in their quest to determine the most appropriate approaches to eliminate this persistent and debilitating disease. The main interventions for schistosomiasis control are reviewed, including preventive chemotherapy using praziquantel, snail control, sanitation, safe water supplies, and behaviour change strategies supported by information, education and communication (IEC) materials. Differences in the biology and transmission of the three main Schistosoma species (i.e. Schistosoma haematobium, S. mansoni and S. japonicum), which impact on control interventions, are considered. Sensitive diagnostic procedures to ensure adequate surveillance in areas attaining low endemicity are required. The importance of capacity building is highlighted. To achieve elimination, an intersectoral approach is necessary, with advocacy and action from local communities and the health community to foster cooperative ventures with engineers, the private sector, governments and non-governmental organizations specialized in water supply and sanitation. Examples of successful schistosomiasis control programmes are reviewed to highlight what has been learnt in terms of strategy for control and elimination. These include St. Lucia and other Caribbean islands, Brazil and Venezuela for S. mansoni; Saudi Arabia and Egypt for both S. mansoni and S. haematobium; Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Mauritius and the Islamic Republic of Iran for S. haematobium; Japan and the People's Republic of China for S. japonicum. Additional targets for elimination or even eradication could be the two minor human schistosome species S. guineenisis and S. intercalatum, which have a restricted distribution in West and Central Africa. The examples show that elimination of schistosomiasis is an achievable and desirable goal requiring full integration of preventive chemotherapy with the tools of transmission control. An agenda for the elimination of schistosomiasis would aim to identify the gaps in knowledge, and define the tools, strategies and guidelines that will help national control programmes move towards elimination, including an internationally accepted mechanism that allows verification/confirmation of elimination. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Taking cognizance of heterogeneity and the "ratchet effect," this paper adopts the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) framework as a starting point and re-estimates the relationship using different panel date models. The main results are obtained by dynamic panel threshold regression models, which divide a balanced panel dataset of 73 countries over the period of 1971-2010 into four groups according to their annual income levels. The key results are: (1) in the low-income group, urbanization decreases energy consumption but increases CO2 emissions; (2) in the middle-/low-income and high-income groups, industrialization decreases energy consumption but increases CO2 emissions, while urbanization significantly increases both energy consumption and CO2 emissions; (3) for the middle-/high-income group, urbanization does not significantly affect energy consumption, but does hinder the growth of emissions; while industrialization was found to have an insignificant impact on energy consumption and CO2 emissions; (4) from the population perspective, it produces positive effects on energy consumption, and also increases emissions except for the high-income group. These novel methodology and findings reveal that different development strategies of urbanization and industrialization should be pursued depending on the levels of income in a bid to conserve energy and reduce emissions.},

	abstract = {The growing demand for electricity has been stimulating studies and actions not only to increase the generation capacity of plants, but also the rational use of this important form of energy. As a result, there is a notable growth in the number of publications related to the theme, thus generating too many works, which makes filtering and analysis complex. In this context, the bibliographic review is an important tool for quantitative and qualitative verification of studies published in different journals. Given the above, this article aims to perform a bibliometric analysis of Brazilian scientific production on energy efficiency applied to electricity consumption. The Scopus database was used to search for articles related to the topic. A total of 66 papers were found in the period from 2004 to 2020, however, after a dynamic reading it was found that only 37 of them effectively talk about energy efficiency linked to electricity consumption. Of these, 83.8\% correspond to case study works, 10.8\% to public policies and 5.4\% were literature review studies. The analysis showed that most of the case study articles were applied to the industrial sector (45.2\%), especially to the driving systems. In addition, it was observed that even though the residential sector is one of the main consumers of energy, there is a small number of publications, thus indicating a gap to be filled.},

	abstract = {Introdução - A tecnologia tem dominado as práticas da medicina, de forma que,
praticamente, todas as especialidades médicas dependem de alguma maneira de
equipamentos médico-hospitalares. Tal dependência aumenta a necessidade de
implementar metodologias eficazes de gestão de tecnologias de forma que tornem os
processos e decisões mais assertivas. Desde 2015, quando o Hospital Universitário
de Lagarto – UFS foi incorporado pela rede EBSERH e passou a receber incentivos,
principalmente pelo Programa Nacional de Reestruturação dos Hospitais
Universitários Federais (Rehuf), foi evidenciado expressivo crescimento e renovação
do parque tecnológico do hospital com volumosas substituições de equipamentos
médico hospitalares, porém, nenhum fluxo, processo ou política de substituição de
equipamentos foi implantado ou utilizado. Objetivo - Propor e implementar uma
ferramenta para substituição de EHM a partir do método AHP no Hospital Universitário
de Lagarto. Metodologia- Tratou-se de uma pesquisa bibliográfica em que foram
utilizadas bases de dados online a fim de determinar o método a ser escolhido, estudo
e descrição do método, proposição da utilização do método AHP na problemática de
substituição de equipamentos médico-hospitalares e aplicação. Resultados - A partir
da metodologia aplicada foi possível elaborar a ferramenta proposta para tomada de
decisão para substituição de equipamentos médico-hospitalares, podendo esta
substituição ser oriunda de compra, doação ou remanejamento interno de
equipamentos no hospital, a ferramenta foi descrita em formato de manual de
instruções para aplicação do método em qualquer hospital da rede EBSERH.
Conclusão - A análise do método AHP apresentou vantagens, como simplicidade e
facilidade de aplicação, além de resposta simples e objetiva.},

There is a spectrum of clinical presentation: asymptomatic infection, symptomatic without jaundice and symptomatic jaundiced. A rare fatal form of hepatitis has been described. Diagnosis of the hepatitis A infection is confirmed by the finding of IgM anti-HAV antibodies, routinely performed using an ELISA test. Treatment is supportive. Intramuscular anti-A gamma globulin is used for passive immune prophylaxis, and there is an efficient vaccine for active immune prophylaxis.},

Hepatitis E is the most important or the second most important cause of acute clinical hepatitis in adults throughout Asia, the Middle East and Africa. In contrast, hepatitis E is rare in industrialized countries, but antibody (anti-HEV) is found worldwide. HEV is a small round RNA-containing virus that is the only member of the genus Hepevirus in the family Hepeviridae. Although similar to hepatitis A virus in appearance, there are significant differences between the two viruses. Hepatitis E is principally the result of a water-borne infection in developing countries and is thought to be spread zoonotically (principally from swine) in industrialized countries. Because diagnostic tests vary greatly in specificity, sensitivity and availability, hepatitis E is probably underdiagnosed. At present, control depends upon improved hygiene; a highly efficacious vaccine has been developed and tested, but it is not presently available.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV), a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, is responsible for acute hepatitis E epidemics in many developing countries, and the virus is also endemic in some industrialized countries. Hepatitis E is a recognized zoonotic disease, and several animal species, including pigs, are potential reservoirs for HEV. The genome of HEV contains three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes the nonstructural proteins, ORF2 encodes the capsid protein, and ORF3 encodes a small multifunctional protein. The ORF2 and ORF3 proteins are translated from a single, bicistronic mRNA. The coding sequences for these two ORFs overlap each other, but neither overlaps with ORF1. Whereas the mechanisms underlying HEV replication are poorly understood, the construction of infectious viral clones, the identification of cell lines that support HEV replication, and the development of small animal models have allowed for more detailed study of the virus. As result of these advances, recently, our understanding of viral entry, genomic replication and viral egress has improved. Furthermore, the determination of the T=1 and T=3 structure of HEV virus-like particles has furthered our understanding of the replication of HEV. This article reviews the latest developments in the molecular biology of HEV with an emphasis on the genomic organization, the expression and function of genes, and the structure and replication of HEV.},

Several reservoirs and transmission modes have been identified. Hepatitis E is an underdiagnosed disease, in part due to the use of serological assays with low sensitivity. However, diagnostic tools, including nucleic acid-based tests, have been improved. The epidemiology and clinical features of hepatitis E differ between developing and developed countries. HEV infection is usually an acute self-limiting disease, but in developed countries it causes chronic infection with rapidly progressive cirrhosis in organ transplant recipients, patients with hematological malignancy requiring chemotherapy, and individuals with HIV. HEV also causes extrahepatic manifestations, including a number of neurological syndromes and renal injury. Acute infection usually requires no treatment, but chronic infection should be treated by reducing immunosuppression in transplant patients and/or the use of antiviral therapy. In this comprehensive review, we summarize the current knowledge about the virus itself, as well as the epidemiology, diagnostics, natural history, and management of HEV infection in developing and developed countries.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections are not limited to the liver but may also affect other organs. Several diseases, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, neuralgic amyotrophy, glomerulonephritis, cryoglobulinemia, pancreatitis, lymphoma, thrombopenia, meningitis, thyroiditis and myocarditis have been observed in the context of hepatitis E. To date, the definite pathophysiological links between HEV and extrahepatic manifestations are not yet established. However, it is suggested that HEV infection might be causative based on serological studies, case series, in vitro data and animal models. In particular, neuronal and renal diseases as well as pancreatitis seem to be caused by HEV, while a causative relationship between HEV and other diseases is more doubtful. Either direct cytopathic tissue damage by extrahepatic replication, or immunological processes induced by an overwhelming host immune response, are possible origins of HEV-associated extrahepatic manifestations. Hepatologists should be aware of the possibility that acute or chronically HEV-infected patients could develop extrahepatic manifestations. Neurologists, nephrologists, rheumatologists and other groups of physicians should consider HEV infection as a potential differential diagnosis when observing one of the diseases described in this review. Ribavirin and steroids have been used in small groups of patients with extrahepatic manifestations of HEV, but the efficacy of these drugs still needs to be verified by large, multicenter studies. This article comprehensively reviews the published literature regarding HEV and extrahepatic manifestations. We discuss the probability of specific extrahepatic diseases being caused by previous or ongoing HEV infection, and summarize the published knowledge about antiviral treatment in extrahepatic disorders.},

Hepatitis E is a disease with a major global impact and has two distinct epidemiological patterns. Hepatitis E is an imperative health issue in developing nations, transmitted through sullied water and happens most every now in young adults. The disease is particularly severe during pregnancy and in people with underlying liver cirrhosis. Autochthonous hepatitis E is increasingly recognized in developed countries. The virus infects domestic pigs, wild boar and Sika deer in these countries. HEV infections in humans occur by eating the undercooked game flesh, raw liver from supermarkets and Figatelli sausages. Blood transfusion-associated HEV infections occur in many countries and screening of donors for HEV RNA is under consideration. Hepatitis E causes a number of extrahepatic diseases, including a wide spectrum of neurological syndromes. HEV genotype 3 causes prolonged viremia, chronic hepatitis, liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in organ transplant patients. The virus is amenable to ribavirin monotherapy and most patients clear the virus in a few weeks.

	abstract = {The newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused more than 11,900 laboratory-confirmed human infections, including 259 deaths, posing a serious threat to human health. Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine. Considering the relatively high identity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV. Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. These results suggest that CR3022 may have the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g. m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, implying that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.},

According to their proponents, this possibility is supported by the small-genome sizes of RNA viruses and their manifold replication strategies, which have been interpreted as the result of an evolutionary exploration of different alternative genome organizations and replication strategies during early evolutionary stages. At the other extreme are the giant DNA viruses, whose genome sizes can be as large as those of some prokaryotes, and which have been grouped by some authors into a fourth domain of life. As argued here, the comparative analysis of the chemical nature and sizes of the viral genomes reported in GenBank does not reveal any obvious correlation with the phylogenetic history of their hosts. Accordingly, it is somewhat difficult to reconcile the proposal of the putative pre-DNA antiquity of RNA viruses, with their extraordinary diversity in plant hosts and their apparent absence among the Archaea. Other issues related to the genome size of all known viruses and subviral agents and the relationship with their hosts are discussed.},

We report here a plausible solution to this problem based on analysis of open reading frame (ORF) length constraints in the genomes of nine diverse species. If primordial nucleic acid sequences were random in sequence, functional proteins that are innately long would not be encoded due to the frequent occurrence of stop codons. The best possible way that a long protein-coding sequence could have been derived was by evolving a split-structure from the random DNA (or RNA) sequence. Results of the systematic analyses of nine complete genome sequences presented here suggests that perhaps the major underlying structural features of split-genes have evolved due to the indigenous occurrence of split protein-coding genes in primordial random nucleotide sequence. The results also suggest that intron-rich genes containing short exons may have been the original form of genes intrinsically occurring in random DNA, and that intron-poor genes containing long exons were perhaps derived from the original intron-rich genes. © 2008 Senapathy et al.},

	abstract = {Introdução e objetivos: Polimorfismos naturais de resistência aos agentes antivirais de atuação direta (DAAs) no vírus da hepatite C (HCV) podem representar um fator limitante para a eficácia dessa terapia. A análise de sequências virais de regiões geográficas distintas pode apresentar diferenças significativas nas frequências de mutações de resistência aos DAAs. Neste contexto, o objetivo deste estudo foi investigar as mutações associadas à resistência aos DAAs nos genes nãoestruturais (NS) do HCV em isolados virais que circulam no Brasil. Métodos: Foram estudados um total de 390 sequências do genótipo 1 do HCV de pacientes brasileiros virgens de tratamento cronicamente infectados. O RNA viral foi extraído, e as regiões abrangendo os genes NS3, NS4 e NS5 foram amplificadas por RT-PCR e sequenciadas. Resultados: No domínio NS3/4A protease, a variação V36L foi encontrada em 5,60\% dos isolados do subtipo 1b, e a substituição T54S em 4,16\% das sequências do subtipo 1a; na posição 55, 4,16\% dos isolados continham a variação V55A, responsável por causar constrição no sítio de ligação do inibidor de protease boceprevir. Em relação à proteína NS4B, um isolado do subtipo 1b apresentou a substituição F98L, responsável por conferir resistência aos inibidores AP80978, PTC725 e silibina. Na proteína NS5A, 3,84\% das sequências do subtipo 1a mostraram as mutações de resistência M28T ou Y93H, e 13,46\%, as mutações secundárias H58P e E62D. Dentre os isolados do subtipo 1b, 3,70\% continham a mutação Y93H, e 14,8\%, as mutações secundárias R30Q, L31M, P58S e I280V. Em NS5B, 25\% das sequências do subtipo 1b brasileiras apresentaram a variação L159F na população viral dominante, mas nenhuma sequência do subtipo 1a exibiu tal substituição. Além disso, em 15 isolados do subtipo 1b (29\%), foi observado o variante C316N, responsável por conferir resistência a inibidores não-nucleosídeos, enquanto que apenas 2,12\% das sequências do isolado do subtipo 1a mostraram a substituição C316Y. A caracterização do subtipo 1a em clados 1 e 2 revelou que as sequências brasileiras das regiões NS3 e NS5A formaram um grupo distinto dentro do clado 1. Adicionalmente em NS3, esse clado apresentou uma característica fenotípica incomum em relação à presença de mutações de resistência aos inibidores macrocíclicos; em particular, a mutação Q80K foi encontrada na maioria das sequências de clado 1, mas não nas amostras brasileiras. Conclusões: Estes dados demonstram que as substituições de resistência a diferentes DAAs podem ser encontradas em isolados circulando no Brasil em pacientes virgens de tratamento antiviral. Além disso, os isolados brasileiros do HCV apresentam um padrão distinto de diversidade genética, reforçando a importância destas informações em futuras abordagens terapêuticas.},

Several types of HBV precore/core (preC/C) mutations have been described to date. The host immune response against T cells drives mutation in the preC/C region. Specifically, preC/C mutations in the MHC class ? restricted region are more common than in other regions and are significantly related to hepatocellular carcinoma. Certain mutations, including preC G1896A, are also significantly related to HBeAg-negative chronic infection.

The authors evaluated sera of 82 patients who had acute hepatitis A (N = 40) and B (N = 42), and of 71 blood donors. TTV was detected by nested-PCR assay and phylogenetic analysis was performed using the neighbor-joining method. TTV was detected in 23\% of patients with acute hepatitis and in 31\% of donors. Mean aminotransferase levels were similar in patients who were TTV positive and TTV negative. A phylogenetic tree was drawn that showed TTV isolates of genotype 1, 2, 3, and 4. In conclusion, TTV infection is more frequent among blood donors than among patients with acute hepatitis A or B in Salvador-Bahia. TTV does not appear to increase the severity of necroinflammatory activity of acute hepatitis A or B. Using phylogenetic analysis TTV isolates of genotype 1, 2, 3, and 4 were encountered in the study population.},

	abstract = {Background \& Aims: Nucleotide polymorphisms upstream of the interleukin 28B (IL28B) gene are strongly associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) clearance in treatment-naïve patients treated with peginterferon/ribavirin (PegIFN/RBV). This subanalysis of the REALIZE study evaluated the impact of IL28B polymorphisms on sustained virologic response (SVR) in telaprevir-treated, HCV genotype 1-infected patients with prior PegIFN/RBV treatment failure. Methods: Treatment-experienced patients were randomized to 12 weeks of telaprevir (750 mg every 8 h) with/without a 4-week PegIFN/RBV lead-in, or placebo, each with PegIFN-α-2a (180 μg/week) and ribavirin (1000-1200 mg/day) for 48 weeks overall. Data from telaprevir arms were pooled. Results: Eighty percent (527/662) of patients consented to genetic testing and were included. Similar proportions of patients had IL28B CC, CT and TT genotypes across treatment arms; baseline characteristics were generally well balanced. SVR rates were higher in the pooled telaprevir versus placebo group for all IL28B genotypes; CC: 79\% versus 29\%, respectively; CT: 60\% versus 16\%, respectively; TT: 61\% versus 13\%, respectively. Within each prior response category (relapse, partial or null response), SVR and viral breakthrough rates with telaprevir-based treatment were comparable across IL28B genotypes. IL28B genotype did not significantly affect SVR (2-step multivariate analyses; p {\textgreater}0.16 in pairwise comparison among CC, TT, and CT). Variations in rapid virologic response and relapse rates were noted in certain patient subgroups. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that IL28B genotype has a limited impact on SVR rates with telaprevir-based therapy in treatment-experienced patients. IL28B genotyping may have limited utility in the baseline evaluation of similar patients considered for telaprevir-based therapy. © 2013 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

In this work, the relationship of E2 to HEV has been probed using three murine monoclonal antibodies, 8C11, 13D8 and 8H3, all of which react predominantly against the E2 dimer, and can effect immune capture of the virus as well. 8C11 and 8H3 were further found to neutralize HEV infectivity in animals. Cross-blocking patterns between these antibodies discerned two spatially separate antigenic domains, one identified by 8C11 and 13D8, and the other, by 8H3. Kinetic studies using BIAcore biosensor suggest that the epitope to which 8H3 is directed is partially masked, and thus has limited access by the native antibody. However, this is not the case with the smaller Fab. Access to the 8H3 epitope was enhanced by the binding of 8C11, and inhibited by the binding of 13D8 to a distal site on the peptide. Similar to the effects of binding 8H3 to E2, 8C11 was found to enhance immune capture by 8H3, while 13D8 was inhibitory. Moreover, 8C11 and 8H3 act synergistically to neutralize HEV infectivity. The parallel cross-reaction patterns that these antibodies exhibit against the peptide and the virus, respectively, implicate two interacting conformationally dependent neutralization sites on the HEV particle. These sites might cooperate in the adsorption and penetration of the HEV virus. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sequence-independent, Single-Primer Amplification (SISPA) is a primer initiated technique that requires target sequence modification to achieve the non-selective logarithmic amplification of heterogeneous DNA populations. The method contrasts with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and its modified approaches, that have as their objective the amplification of unique or homologous sequences. SISPA requires the directional ligation of an asymmetric linker/primer oligonucleotide onto the target population of blunt ended DNA molecules. The common end sequence allows one strand of the double-stranded linker/primer to be used in repeated rounds of annealing, extension and denaturation in the presence of thermostable Taq DNA polymerase. The linker/primers contain restriction endonuclease sites to facilitate the molecular cloning of as little as 1 pg of starting material after amplification. SISPA is especially useful when the nucleotide sequence of the desired molecule is both unknown and present in limited amounts making its recovery by standard cloning procedures technically difficult. These conditions are present in the initial isolation and cloning of previously uncharacterized viral genomes. The application and quantitation of SISPA is described, together with its utility in the cloning and recovery of low abundance genetic sequences, as illustrated here with the hepatitis C virus. © 1991 Academic Press Ltd.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the major causative agent of hepatitis E or what was formerly known as enterically transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis. The disease has a worldwide distribution but occurs principally in developing countries in any of three forms: large epidemics, smaller outbreaks, or sporadic infections. Genetic variation of different HEV strains was previously noted and it will be important to determine the extent to which this variation may pose problems in the diagnosis and treatment of HEV infection. To analyze differences at the genetic level between HEV(Mexico; M) and the previously characterized HEV(Burma; B) and HEV(Pakistan; P) isolates, overlapping cDNAs were cloned from samples obtained from an infected human and an experimentally inoculated cynomolgus macaque. These cDNA clones, representing the nearly complete (7185-bp) genome of HEV(M), confirmed an expression strategy for the virus that involves the use of 3 forward open reading frames (ORFs). The HEV(M) strain has an overall 76 and 77\% nucleic acid identity with the HEV(B) strain and HEV(P) strain, respectively; however, the degree of sequence variation was not uniform throughout the viral genome. A hypervariable region was identified in ORF1 that exhibited a 58 and 54\% nucleic acid sequence and 13\% amino acid similarity with the Burma strain and the Pakistan strain, respectively. A large number of the nucleotide differences occurred at the third codon position, with the deduced amino acid sequences similarity of 83, 93, and 87\% between HEV(M) and HEV(B) isolates in ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3, respectively, and with 84, 93, and 87\% amino acid identities between HEV(M) and HEV(P) isolates in ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3, respectively. The nucleotide sequences derived from the highly conserved regions of HEV genome will be useful in developing polymerase chain reaction-based tests to confirm the viral infection. Knowledge of the extent of the sequence variation encountered with HEV will not only aid in the future development of diagnostic and vaccine reagents but also further our understanding of how HEV strain variation might impact the pathological outcome of infection. © 1992.},

Essas modificações químicas no DNA são constantemente feitas e desfeitas durante toda a vida do indivíduo, exceto para marcações químicas constitutivas que são herdadas geneticamente, visto que freqüentemente os indivíduos entram em contato com agentes promotores desses fenômenos durante a vida. Alterações nos padrões epigenéticos promovendo a expressão aberrante ou o silenciamento de determinados genes podem aparecer em organismos com idade avançada, e em uma ampla variedade de eventos e patologias como no câncer, na inativação do cromossomo X, no imprinting genômico, e em diversas síndromes de ordem neurológica e de prejuízo no desenvolvimento motor. Desse modo, busca-se atualmente o desenvolvimento de drogas que possuem a capacidade de reverter as marcações químicas alteradas em regiões específicas do genoma relacionadas a determinadas doenças.

Abstract Epigenetics includes several mechanisms that promote the gene expression regulation at transcriptional level through chemical changes in DNA and chromatin, such as methylation, acetylation and phosphorylation, resulting in phenotypic change without no changes occur in the DNA sequence. These DNA chemical changes are constantly made and unmade throughout the individual life, except for constitutive chemical markings that are genetically inherited, because often people are in contact with agents that promote these phenomens during their lifes. Changes in epigenetic patterns promoting aberrant expression or gene silencing may appear in aged organisms, and in a wide variety of events and conditions such as cancer, X chromosome inactivation in genomic imprinting, and in various neurological and motor development syndromes. Thus, seek currently drugs development that have the ability to reverse altered chemical markings in specific regions of the genome related to certain diseases. A greater understanding of the epigenetic universe associated with its implications to normal physiological and pathological states, it is a great promise in molecular era to development of prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic tools of a wide variety of diseases.},

	abstract = {The mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) occurs in 4\%- 
13\% of pregnancies when the mothers are infected and very few studies were 
conducted to determine the HCV prevalence in pregnant women in Brazil. The aim of 
this work was to determine the prevalence and associated factors of HCV infection in 
pregnant women, and the rate of the MTCT of HCV. It was conducted in Salvador, 
between March 2009 and April 2011, at the maternity hospital Prof. José Maria 
Magalhães Netto. All volunteers signed to informed consent, their medical records 
were reviewed and serum samples were collect for screening anti-HCV antibody by a 
rapid anti-HCV testing (Bioeasy), ELISA 3rd generation (Artech), and HCV-RNA 
qualitative and quantitative detection (AMPLICOR HCV TEST, ROCHE version 2.0). 
In a randomly selected pregnant women subsample, interviews were made to 
evaluate socio-demographic and exposure factors for HCV, not available in the 
records. The descriptive and association statistical analysis were performed using 
Epi Info 3.5.3 (CDC, Atlanta, GE, USA). The study included 3.049 pregnant women, 
8 (0.26\%; 95\% CI: 0.12\%-0.50\%) were anti-HCV positive by ELISA and 6 (0.20\%; 
95\% CI: 0.08\%-0.41\%) confirmed viremia. All genotypes HCV belonged to genotype 
1, 1a or 1b. Injection and inhaled drug use, tattoo and piercing were the most 
important associated factors for the mother infection. Out of the 6 HCV infected 
mothers, 2 (33.3\%; 95\% CI: 6.0\%-73.8\%) transmitted HCV to their newborns. In one 
of the cases of MTCT, the mother reported to injection and inhaled drug user during 
pregnancy, had tattoo and was HIV carrier held under antiretroviral therapy. The 
newborn was born at gestational age (GA) 38 weeks by elective cesarean section. In 
the other case, the mother was also injection and inhaled drug user, had piercing and 
tattooing. Her newborn was born at GA 39 weeks by normal delivery, and time of 
rupture of membranes was estimated to be 15 hours. We conclude that the 
prevalence of HCV infection among pregnant women was lower than the prevalence 
in the general population in the same locality, been associated to drug use and 
tattoo. The rate of MTCT of HCV was higher than expected. Thus, larger studies are 
required.},

Improving the biological accuracy of annotation is a complex and iterative process requiring researchers to review and incorporate multiple sources of information such as transcriptome alignments, predictive models based on sequence profiles, and comparisons to features found in related organisms. Because rapidly decreasing costs are enabling an ever-growing number of scientists to incorporate sequencing as a routine laboratory technique, there is widespread demand for tools that can assist in the deliberative analytical review of genomic information. To this end, we present Apollo, an open source software package that enables researchers to efficiently inspect and refine the precise structure and role of genomic features in a graphical browser-based platform. Some of Apollo's newer user interface features include support for real-time collaboration, allowing distributed users to simultaneously edit the same encoded features while also instantly seeing the updates made by other researchers on the same region in a manner similar to Google Docs. Its technical architecture enables Apollo to be integrated into multiple existing genomic analysis pipelines and heterogeneous laboratory workflow platforms. Finally, we consider the implications that Apollo and related applications may have on how the results of genome research are published and made accessible.},

Com base nos algoritmos de classificação de cada critério, classificamos os 55.970 domicílios que compõem a amostra representativa da pesquisa de orçamentos familiares (POF), realizada pelo Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE). Os resultados obtidos permitem afirmar que o classificador de máxima verossimilhança foi o que apresentou a melhor performance em explicar o nível de consumo das famílias brasileiras por estrato socioeconômico, seguido do classificador bayesiano adaptável, da Associação Brasileira de Empresas de Pesquisa (ABEP) simplificado, do ABEP antigo e da Secretaria de Assuntos Estratégicos (SAE). Os três primeiros classificadores estão sustentados no conceito da renda permanente/riqueza do domicílio, incorporando os dois primeiros uma importante inovação: classificar um domicílio levando em conta sua localização geográfica e a composição familiar. Esses novos classificadores possibilitam aos pesquisadores e gestores de marketing segmentar e estudar mercados baseados em critério válido, fidedigno e confiável de estratificação socioeconômica.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The sample was selected using stratified multi-stage cluster sampling and was drawn with equal probability from each domain of study (region and age-group). Nationwide, 19,280 households and {\textasciitilde}31,000 residents were selected. The study is large enough to detect prevalence of viral infec-tion around 0.1\% and risk factor assessments within each region. The methodology seems to be a viable way of differentiating between distinct epidemiological patterns of hepatitis A, B and C.

MÉTODOS: Foram avaliados através de estudo de corte transversal com coleta prospectiva de dados 237 internos no Hospital Penal da Bahia entre julho de 2003 e abril de 2004. Um questionário padronizado foi preenchido por estudantes de medicina. Os indivíduos foram sistematicamente submetidos aos seguintes exames: teste tuberculínico, radiografia de tórax em incidência póstero-anterior, baciloscopia e cultura para micobactérias. Os eventos de interesse foram TB ativa e TB latente. RESULTADOS: A média de idade foi de 36,6 anos, sendo 89,9\% homens. Tabagismo e alcoolismo foram relatados por 70.0\% e 43.9\% dos internos, respectivamente. História de tratamento para TB foi relatada por 11,3\% dos indivíduos. Dos internos avaliados, 36,3\% relataram tosse e 31,4\%, expectoração. Outros sintomas menos frequentemente referidos foram astenia (26,2\%), perda de peso (23,1\%), inapetência (17,7\%), febre (11,3\%) e hemoptise (6,7\%). Nenhum dos 86 internos testados apresentou sorologia anti-HIV positiva. Entre os 156 submetidos ao teste tuberculínico, a prevalência de TB latente foi de 61,5\% (146 casos). Do total, 6 casos de TB ativa foram detectados (prevalência de 2,5\%). A presença de tosse foi um determinante de TB ativa (razão de prevalência = 8,8; IC95\%: 1,04-73,9; p = 0,025). CONCLUSÕES: A população de internos do Hospital Penal da Bahia tem altas prevalências de TB latente e ativa. Estes achados justificam a necessidade de implantação de políticas públicas especificamente direcionadas para o controle da TB nesta população},

	abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a positive-strand RNA virus transmitted by the fecal-oral route. The 7.2 kb genome encodes three open reading frames (ORF) which are translated into (i) the ORF1 polyprotein, representing the viral replicase, (ii) the ORF2 protein, corresponding to the viral capsid, and (iii) the ORF3 protein, a small protein involved in particle secretion. Although HEV is a non-enveloped virus in bile and feces, it circulates in the bloodstream wrapped in cellular membranes. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 infect only humans and cause mainly waterborne outbreaks. HEV genotypes 3 and 4 are widely represented in the animal kingdom and are transmitted as a zoonosis mainly via contaminated meat. HEV infection is usually self-limited but may persist and cause chronic hepatitis in immunocompromised patients. Reduction of immunosuppressive treatment or antiviral therapy with ribavirin have proven effective in most patients with chronic hepatitis E but therapy failures have been reported. Alternative treatment options are needed, therefore. Infection with HEV may also cause a number of extrahepatic manifestations, especially neurologic complications. Progress in the understanding of the biology of HEV should contribute to improved control and treatment of HEV infection.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a single-stranded RNA virus that causes large-scale epidemics of acute viral hepatitis, particularly in developing countries. In men and non-pregnant women, the disease is usually self-limited and has a case-fatality rate of less than {\textless}0.1\%. However, in pregnant women, particularly from certain geographical areas in India, HEV infection is more severe, often leading to fulminant hepatic failure and death in a significant proportion of patients. In contrast, reports from Egypt, Europe and the USA have shown that the course and severity of viral hepatitis during pregnancy is not different from that in non-pregnant women. The reasons for this geographical difference are not clear. The high mortality rate in pregnancy has been thought to be secondary to the associated hormonal (oestrogen and progesterone) changes during pregnancy and consequent immunological changes. These immunological changes include downregulation of the p65 component of nuclear factor (NF-kappaB) with a predominant T-helper type 2 (Th2) bias in the T-cell response along with host susceptibility factors, mediated by human leucocyte antigen expression. Thus far, researchers were unable to explain the high HEV morbidity in pregnancy, why it is different from other hepatitis viruses such as hepatitis A with similar epidemiological features and the reason behind the difference in HEV morbidity in pregnant women in different geographical regions. The recent developments in understanding the immune response to HEV have encouraged us to review the possible mechanisms for these differences. Further research in the immunology of HEV and pregnancy is required to conquer this disease in the near future.},

The prevalence of infections was low: HIV-1.6\%; HCV-2.4\%; HBV- 0.8\%; HTLV I/II-4.0\%; and syphilis-4.0\%. The combination of dire poverty and high prevalence of risk behaviors turn such populations a preferential target of initiatives aiming to reduce drug-related harm and promote social development. Low infection rates should not be viewed with complacency, but as a window of opportunity to implement prevention initiatives and reduce social marginalization.},

In-depth analysis was restricted to works which were shown in their entirety and free of charge hosted on SciELO. It revealed that scientific production is present all over the world with a predominantly quantitative approach. It focuses on identifying the socio-demographic profile and health conditions of prisoners, the incidence of tuberculosis, Human Immunodeficiency and Hepatitis C virus infections. There is a predominance of studies carried out with male prisoners, in comparison with the female sex. It is clear that prisoner health is a public health problem on the rise, which demands research that can orient health policies and strategies.(AU)},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are both transmitted by the faecal-oral route, and represent common causes of acute hepatitis in developing countries. The endemicity of HAV infection has shifted from high to moderate in Brazil. Human cases of HEV infection seem to be rare, although the virus has been detected in swine livestock and effluents of slaughterhouses. This study was to determine the epidemiology of hepatitis A and E in one of the largest agricultural settlements in the Amazon Basin of Brazil. METHODS Serum samples collected from 397 individuals aged between 5 and 90 years during a population-based cross-sectional survey were tested for anti-HAV and anti-HEV antibodies. Associated risk factors and spatial clustering of HAV and HEV seropositivity were also analyzed. RESULTS The overall rate of HAV seropositivity was 82.9\% (95\% confidence interval (CI), 79.2-86.6\%). Multilevel logistic regression analysis identified increasing age (in years; odds ratio (OR), 1.097; 95\% CI, 1.050-1.147; P {\textless} 0.001) and crowding (OR, 1.603; 95\% CI, 1.054-2.440; P = 0.028) as significant risk factors for HAV seropositivity. Anti-HEV IgG was detected in 50/388 settlers (12.9\%, 95\% CI, 9.5-16.2\%). Anti-HEV IgM was detected in 7/43 (16.3\%) anti-IgG positive samples, and 4 of them had a confirmed result by immunoblot. Increasing age was the only significant determinant of HEV seropositivity (OR, 1.033; 95\% CI, 1.016-1.050; P {\textless} 0.001). No significant spatial clustering of HAV and HEV seropositivity was detected in the area. CONCLUSIONS Both HAV and HEV are endemic, with differing rates of infection in children and adults in this rural setting of the Brazilian Amazon. Anti-HEV prevalence was considerably higher than those previously reported in Brazil. The detection of HEV- specific IgM antibodies in four asymptomatic individuals is highly suggestive of the circulation of HEV in this rural population.},

	abstract = {Assays to determine the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype have recently become useful for clinical decision making and may be suitable for epidemiological investigations, such as identifying HCV outbreaks in a given population. Molecular assays are the most common diagnostic tools for HCV genotyping. This study compares two genome typing assays, one, the Trugene 5′NC genotyping kit, uses the sequence of the 5′ non-coding (5′NC) region and the other, a non-commercial assay, uses the non-structural 5b (NS5b) region. Serum samples from 203 chronically HCV-infected patients were tested. The 5′NC and the NS5b assays were both very effective in identifying the genotype (99 and 98.5\%) and the results with the two methods were always concordant for the genotype. The NS5b analysis permitted the identification of the subtype in all samples, whereas the 5′NC region assay did not in 33\% of samples. The NS5b analysis showed that one patient had a mixed infection with HCV subtypes 1a and 2c, while the 5′NC assay did not. It is concluded that phylogenetic analysis using both the 5′NC and the NS5b regions are reliable and convenient methods for HCV typing in clinical practice. But analysis of the NS5b region may be more useful for tracing the source of an HCV infection. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To summarize and evaluate the published literature pertaining to boceprevir and telaprevir, and to provide clinicians with suggestions for use in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection. METHODS A standardized search strategy was performed using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar and International Pharmaceuticals Abstracts databases using the search terms "boceprevir", "telaprevir", "boceprevir and hepatitis C", and "telaprevir and hepatitis C". A manual search of references was performed to identify articles missed by the electronic search. Studies were included in the review if they assessed either boceprevir or telaprevir in comparison with standard of care in chronic hepatitis C patients. RESULTS The studies identified assessed boceprevir and telaprevir in genotype-1 hepatitis C patients. In both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, sustained virological response rates were achieved more often with boceprevir or telaprevir in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin compared with pegylated interferon and ribavirin alone. Both medications were well tolerated, with anemia presenting as the most treatment-limiting adverse effect. CONCLUSIONS Boceprevir and telaprevir will revolutionize the management of hepatitis C genotype 1 patients and will most likely decrease the burden of end-stage disease worldwide. However, current clinical limitations include establishing appropriate and cost-effective treatment durations, and use in special populations such as transplant patients and patients coinfected with HIV. Future research will need to clarify these clinical obstacles to clearly define the role of these agents in hepatitis C management.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes infectious hepatitis worldwide. It is transmitted mainly by blood products and sharing of intravenous paraphernalia during illicit drug use. High prevalence rates have been described among specific groups considered to be at higher risk for HCV infection, including prison inmates. The objectives of this study were: to determine the HCV seroprevalence among inmates of Casa de Detenção de São Paulo; to identify risk factors for HCV infection; and to compare the seroprevalence of HCV to other blood borne or sexually transmitted diseases. From December, 1993, to January, 1994, a total of 779 inmates were interviewed to collect information on sociodemographic status, sexual behavior, and past experience with illicit drugs. Blood samples were obtained from 756 inmates for serological tests. 310 (41\%) blood samples were positive for anti-HCV, 425 (56.2\%) were negative, and 21 (2.8\%) showed indeterminate results. In this population, we found a seroprevalence of 13.7\% for HIV, 3.3\% for syphilis (VDRL), and 68.1\% for hepatitis B virus previous infection. Four variables were each identified as associated with a positive anti-HCV serologic test: a positive VDRL (OR = 2.63 IC 95\% 1.08 to 6.36); a time of current imprisonment longer than 130 months (OR = 2.44 IC 95\% 1.04 to 5.71); previous incarceration at Casa de Detenção de São Paulo (OR = 1.73 IC 95\% 1.19 to 2.52) and; illicit drug use before admission to the Casa de Detenção de São Paulo (OR = 1.64 IC 95\% 1.15 to 2.33). The seroprevalence of HCV antibodies among the study population was high (41\%), indeed, one of the highest clusters of HCV infection recorded until now. Four variables were each shown to be associated with HCV infection. The simultaneous presence of these 4 variables is associated with an 82\% probability of being anti-HCV positive. Although risk factor analysis indicates most HCV infections occur prior to inprisonment, initiation of control measures to prevent continued transmission after incarceration should be done.},

This study sought to estimate the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and syphilis among prison inmates and officers at prisons in Nsawan and Accra, Ghana. Prisoners and officers in 3 of the 46 prisons in Ghana were surveyed from May 2004 to May 2005. Subjects voluntarily completed a risk-factor questionnaire and provided blood specimens for unlinked anonymous testing for the presence of antibodies to HIV, HCV and Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, and the surface antigen of hepatitis B virus (HBsAg). Almost 16\% (3770) of the total of 23,980 prison inmates in Ghana were eligible, and 281 (7.5\%) of those eligible took part, whilst almost 23\% (1120) of the total of 4910 prison officers were eligible, and 82 (7.3\%) of those eligible took part. For the 281 inmates tested, HIV seroprevalence was 19.2\%, 17.4\% had HBsAg, HCV seroprevalence was 19.2\% and reactive syphilis serology was noted in 11\%. For the 82 officers tested, HIV seroprevalence was 8.5\%, 3.7\% had HBsAg, HCV seroprevalence was 23.2\% and reactive syphilis serology was noted in 4.9\%. The data indicate a higher prevalence of HIV and HCV in correctional facilities (both prison inmates and officers) than in the general population in Ghana, suggesting their probable transmission in prisons in Ghana through intravenous drug use, unsafe sexual behaviour and tattooing as pertains to prisons worldwide.},

	abstract = {SETTING: A prison (1171 male inmates) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and to assess the performance of several screening strategies. DESIGN: In a cross-sectional study, all inmates underwent chest radiographic screening. Subjects with abnormal findings underwent sputum smear examination and sputum culture. Taking this strategy as the reference, we assessed three targeted screening strategies to identify TB suspects: Strategy 1: cough {\textgreater}3 weeks; Strategy 2: WHO score {\textgreater} or = 5; Strategy 3: presence of at least one potentially TB-related symptom. RESULTS: The prevalence of TB cases was 4.6\% (48/1052) and 2.7\% for definite TB cases. If TB suspects identified by targeted screening had sputum smear examination alone, 37 (86.0\%) of the 43 cases would have been missed by Strategy 1, 34/43 (79.1\%) by Strategy 2 and 34/43 (79.1\%) by Strategy 3. If TB suspects had both sputum smear examination and, for smear-negative subjects, chest radiography, respectively 28/43 (65.1\%), 18/43 (41.9\%) and 13/43 (30.2\%) of cases would have been missed. CONCLUSION: All three targeted screening strategies were unreliable. Given the importance of early TB diagnosis in overcrowded and highly endemic settings, routine radiography-based screening may be warranted.},

	abstract = {A cross-sectional study was carried out among 996 volunteer blood donors enrolled from May 1999 to December 1999 to determine the seroprevalence of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection among volunteer blood donors of the Regional Blood Bank of Londrina, State of Paraná, Brazil, and to evaluate whether the rate of seroprevalence of IgG anti-HEV antibodies is associated with sociodemographic variables and with seropositivity for hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection. All participants answered the questionnaire regarding the sociodemographic characterisitcs. Serum samples were tested for IgG antibodies to HEV (anti-HEV) by an enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA). All serum samples positive for anti-HEV IgG and 237 serum samples negative for anti-HEV were also assayed for IgG anti-HAV antibodies by ELISA. Anti-HEV IgG was confirmed in 23/996 samples, resulting in a seroprevalence of 2.3\% for HEV infection, similar to previous results obtained in developed countries. No significant association was found between the presence of anti-HEV IgG antibodies and the sociodemographic variables including gender, age, educational level, rural or urban areas, source of water, and sewer system (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Also, no association with seropositivity for anti-HAV IgG antibodies was observed (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Although this study revealed a low seroprevalence of HEV infection in the population evaluated, the results showed that this virus is circulating among the population from Londrina, South Brazil, and point out the need of further studies to define the clinical and epidemiological importance of HEV infection and to identify additional risk factors involved in the epidemiology and pathogenesis of this infection in this population.},

	abstract = {Background: Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents target HCV proteins; some of these have already been approved for the treatment of HCV infection, while others are in development. However, selection of DAA-resistant viral variants may hamper treatment. The aim of this study was to illustrate potential natural DAA-resistance mutations in the HCV NS5A and NS5B regions of HCV genotypes 1a and 1b from DAA-naïve patients. Methods. Direct sequencing of HCV NS5A and NS5B regions was performed in 32 patients infected with HCV genotype 1a and 30 patients infected with HCV genotype 1b; all subjects were naïve to DAAs. Results: In genotype 1a strains, resistance mutations in NS5A (M28V, L31M and H58P) were observed in 4/32 (12.5\%) patients, and resistance mutations in NS5B (V321I, M426L, Y448H, Y452H) were observed in 4/32 (12.5\%) patients. In genotype 1b, resistance mutations in NS5A (L28V, L31M, Q54H, Y93H and I280V) were observed in 16/30 (53.3\%) patients, while resistance mutations in NS5B (L159F, V321I, C316N, M426L, Y452H, R465G and V499A) were observed in 27/30 (90\%) patients. Conclusions: Mutations conferring DAA resistance were detected in NS5A and NS5B of HCV genotypes 1a and 1b from DAA-naïve patients. Although some mutations confer only a low level of resistance, the presence at baseline of mutated HCV variants should be taken into consideration in the context of DAA therapy. © 2013 Paolucci et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The discovery of this novel enveloped form of HEV has raised a series of questions about the fundamental biology of HEV and the way this virus, which has been understudied in the past, interacts with its host. Here, we review recent advances towards understanding this phenomenon and discuss its potential impact on various aspects of the HEV life cycle and immunity.},

Optimization recommendations focus on library-dependent methods and include improved selection of restriction enzymes or antibiotics, better definition of appropriate library size, selection of target species and choice of statistical pattern-matching algorithms. Methods development recommendations focus on identifying new genomic targets and quantification procedures for library-independent methods. Longer-term methods development recommendations include integration of microarrays and other direct pathogen detection technology with MST. Studies defining host specificity and population dynamics should aid selection of target species during methods development. Evaluation recommendations include enhancements that should be incorporated into future methods comparison studies, along with studies to assess the value of MST results for risk characterization.},

However, a broad range of extrahepatic manifestations (in particular, idiopathic neurological disorders) have been recently reported in association with its infection. In this study, we have demonstrated that various human neural cell lines (embryonic stem cell-derived neural lineage cells) induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human neurons and primary mouse neurons are highly susceptible to HEV infection. Treatment with interferon-alpha or ribavirin, the off-label antiviral drugs for chronic hepatitis E, exerted potent antiviral activities against HEV infection in neural cells. More importantly, in mice and monkey peripherally inoculated with HEV particles, viral RNA and protein were detected in brain tissues. Finally, patients with HEV-associated neurological disorders shed the virus into cerebrospinal fluid, indicating a direct infection of their nervous system. Thus, HEV is neurotropic in vitro, and in mice, monkeys, and possibly humans. These results challenge the dogma of HEV as a pure hepatotropic virus and suggest that HEV infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of idiopathic neurological disorders.},

Prison officers are considered to have an intermittent exposure potential to bloodborne infectious diseases on the job, however there has been no studies on the prevalence of these infections in prison officers in Ghana. METHODS A national multicenter cross-sectional study was undertaken on correlates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and syphilis infections in sample of prison inmates and officers from eight of ten regional central prisons in Ghana. A total of 1366 inmates and 445 officers were enrolled between May 2004 and December 2005. Subjects completed personal risk-factor questionnaire and provided blood specimens for unlinked anonymous testing for presence of antibodies to HIV, HCV and Treponema pallidum; and surface antigen of HBV (HBsAg). These data were analyzed using both univariate and multivariate techniques. RESULTS Almost 18\% (1336) of 7652 eligible inmates and 21\% (445) of 2139 eligible officers in eight study prisons took part. Median ages of inmates and officers were 36.5 years (range 16-84) and 38.1 years (range 25-59), respectively. Among inmates, HIV seroprevalence was 5.9\%, syphilis seroprevalence was 16.5\%, and 25.5\% had HBsAg. Among officers tested, HIV seroprevalence was 4.9\%, HCV seroprevalence was 18.7\%, syphilis seroprevalence was 7.9\%, and 11.7\% had HBsAg. Independent determinants for HIV, HBV and syphilis infections among inmates were age between 17-46, being unmarried, being illiterate, female gender, being incarcerated for longer than median time served of 36 months, history of homosexuality, history of intravenous drug use, history of sharing syringes and drug paraphernalia, history of participation in paid sexual activity, and history of sexually transmitted diseases. Independent determinants for HIV, HBV, HCV and syphilis infections among officers were age between 25-46, fale gender, being unmarried, being employed in prison service for longer than median duration of employment of 10 years, and history of sexually transmitted diseases. CONCLUSION The comparably higher prevalence of HIV, HBV, HCV and syphilis in prison inmates and officers in Ghana suggests probable occupational related transmission. The implementation of infection control practices and risk reduction programs targeted at prison inmates and officers in Ghana is urgently required to address this substantial exposure risk.},

For many non-neoplastic dermatological diseases like localized scleroderma, acne vulgaris and viral warts a therapeutical benefit of PDT is evident, too. Unlike the formerly used, only systemically-applicable haematoporphyrin deri- vates, the recently developed topical photosensitizers 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) or its methyl ester (MAL) induce photosensitizing porphy- rins. Moreover, the latter do not induce strong generalized cutaneous photosensitization. Due to the easy accessibility of skin to light activa- tion, incoherent lamps or LED arrays are suitable for PDT. The produc- tion of reactive oxygen intermediates like singlet oxygen depends on the applied light dose as well as the concentration and localization of the photosensitizer in the diseased tissue. Either cytotoxic effects resulting in tumor destruction or immunomodulatory effects improving inflam- matory skin conditions are induced. Treating superficial non-melanoma skin cancer, PDT has been shown to be highly efficient despite the low level of invasiveness. The excellent cosmetic results after treatment are beneficial, too.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A hepatite A é conhecida desde as antigas civilizações chinesa, grega e romana, mas o primeiro relato escrito se deu no século 18. O agente é um picornavírus, do genêro Hepatovírus e o RNA viral possui fita simples. Existem sete genótipos. Nas infecções naturais, os anticorpos das classes IgM e IgA são os mais precoces, aparecendo junto com as primeiras manifestações clínicas, mas podem surgir apenas no final da primeira semana de doença. A infecção pelo vírus da hepatite A resulta em infecção assintomática, infecção sintomática anictérica, ou em infecção sintomática ictérica. A forma fulminante da hepatite não é freqüente. O diagnóstico etiológico é feito pela pesquisa dos anticorpos anti-VHA da classe IgM, geralmente, pelo método de ELISA. Nenhum medicamento, exceto os sintomáticos, devem ser prescritos. A imunoprofilaxia passiva é feita pela injeção intramuscular de gamaglobulina anti-A e a imunoprofilaxia ativa através da vacinação.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Hepatitis E virus infection can cause chronic hepatitis in immunocompromised patients with significant chance of progressive fibrosis and possibly cirrhosis. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the efficacy and safety of the various treatment options for chronic hepatitis E. We performed a systematic literature search. The primary outcome measure was a sustained virological response (SVR). Secondary end points were rapid virological response (RVR), relapse rates, side effects and adverse events. Forty‐four articles were included with a total of 582 patients. Reduction of immunosuppressive medication induced viral clearance in 55/174 (32\%) of the patients. Meta‐analysis of 395 patients showed a pooled SVR rate of 78\% (95‐CI 72\%–84\%) after ribavirin treatment. Twenty‐five per cent of the patients obtained a RVR, whereas a relapse occurred in 18\% of the patients. Anaemia during treatment led to dose reduction, use of erythropoietin and/or blood transfusion in 37\% of the patients. A second treatment attempt with ribavirin led to a SVR in 39/51 (76\%) of the patients. Pegylated interferon‐alpha was administered to 13 patients and SVR was obtained in 85\%. Two patients (15\%) suffered from acute transplant rejection during treatment with interferon. In conclusion, reduction of immunosuppressive medication and treatment with ribavirin is safe, generally well tolerated and induced viral clearance in 32\% and 78\% of patients, respectively. Therefore, ribavirin should be considered as first treatment step for chronic hepatitis E. Treatment with pegylated interferon‐alpha increases the risk of transplant rejection and should therefore be administered with great caution.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In this interview, Green Illusions author Ozzie Zehner says that alternative energy technologies such as solar cells and wind turbines have become fetishes and spectacles that do nothing to offset coal use. Instead, he says, these technologies serve mostly as symbols that distract Americans and prevent them from considering cleaner and more affordable solutions to climate change and other environmental problems. He argues that subsidizing alternative energy technologies actually has a boomerang effect: By making energy cheaper for consumers, it increases the demand for energy. Zehner criticizes electric cars as inventions that are no better for the environment than gasoline-powered vehicles and that simply perpetuate a vehicle-centered culture. He describes how media coverage of energy-producing technologies such as solar cells and biofuels soars along with gas prices, while coverage of energy-saving technologies such as insulation stagnates. In Zehner's view, Americans don't have an energy crisis; they have a consumption crisis. He recommends that, instead of concentrating so much effort on developing alternative technologies, each of which comes with an unavoidable downside, environmentalists should focus on social and political programs - he cites youth cycling programs as one example - that are good for public health as well as the planet. Zehner suggests that such programs need to provide immediate personal benefits and long-term climate stabilization. © The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV), an RNA virus of the Hepeviridae family, has marked heterogeneity. While all five HEV genotypes can cause human infections, genotypes HEV-1 and -2 infect humans alone, genotypes HEV-3 and -4 primarily infect pigs, boars and deer, and genotype HEV-7 primarily infects dromedaries. The global distribution of HEV has distinct epidemiological patterns based on ecology and socioeconomic factors. In resource-poor countries, disease presents as large-scale waterborne epidemics, and few epidemics have spread through person-to-person contact; however, endemic diseases within these countries can potentially spread through person-to-person contact or fecally contaminated water and foods. Vertical transmission of HEV from infected mother to fetus causes high fetal and perinatal mortality. Other means of transmission, such as zoonotic transmission, can fluctuate depending upon the region and strain of the virus. For instance, zoonotic transmission can sometimes play an insignificant role in human infections, such as in India, where human and pig HEV infections are unrelated. However, recently China and Southeast Asia have experienced a zoonotic spread of HEV-4 from pigs to humans and this has become the dominant mode of transmission of hepatitis E in eastern China. Zoonotic HEV infections in humans occur by eating undercooked pig flesh, raw liver, and sausages; through vocational contact; or via pig slurry, which leads to environmental contamination of agricultural products and seafood. Lastly, blood transfusion-associated HEV infections occur in many countries and screening of donors for HEV RNA is currently under serious consideration. To summarize, HEV genotypes 1 and 2 cause epidemic and endemic diseases in resource poor countries, primarily spreading through contaminated drinking water. HEV genotypes 3 and 4 on the other hand, cause autochthonous infections in developed, and many developing countries, by means of a unique zoonotic food-borne transmission.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS The Detection of hepatitis A virus (HAV) is important for diagnosis and epidemiological studies of hepatitis A. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique is a sensitive test to detect HAV-RNA in specimens. The aims of the present study were to clarify the detection rate of serum HAV-RNA by PCR and the natural history of HAV viraemia, and to determine the correlation between viraemia and the clinical characteristics in patients with acute hepatitis A. METHODS Hepatitis A virus RNA was tested in 74 serum samples which were serially collected from 27 patients with acute hepatitis A. A nested reverse transcription (RT)-PCR for HAV-RNA was performed with primer sets located at the VP1 region of the HAV genome and the PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1.5\% agarose gel. RESULTS Hepatitis A virus RNA was found in 18 of 27 (67\%) patients with hepatitis A. There were no significant differences between groups positive and negative for HAV-RNA in clinical and laboratory data, except the time interval between clinical onset and initial serum sampling for RT-PCR (10 +/- 6 vs 19 +/- 14 days) and the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level at initial serum sampling for RT-PCR (1436 +/- 1416 vs 518 +/- 432 IU/L). The mean duration of HAV viraemia was 30 +/- 19 days (range, 5-59 days). The duration of HAV viraemia and duration of abnormal ALT levels from clinical onset were positively correlated (r = 0.685, P = 0.007). CONCLUSION In conclusion, HAV-RNA RT-PCR is a useful tool to detect HAV viraemia and to study the molecular epidemiology of HAV infection.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of viral hepatitis globally. There is growing concern about transfusion-transmitted HEV (TT-HEV) as an emerging global health problem. HEV can potentially result in chronic infection in immunocompromised patients, leading to a higher risk of liver cirrhosis and even death. Between 0.0013\% and 0.281\% of asymptomatic blood donors around the world have HEV viremia, and 0.27\% to 60.5\% have anti-HEV immunoglobulin G. HEV is infectious even at very low blood concentrations of the virus. Immunosuppressed patients who develop persistent hepatitis E infection should have their immunosuppressant regimen reduced; ribavirin may be considered as treatment. Pegylated interferon can be considered in those who are refractory or intolerant to ribavirin. Sofosbuvir, a nucleotide analog, showed modest antiviral activity in some clinical studies but sustained viral response was not achieved. Therefore, rescue treatment remains an unmet need. The need for HEV screening of all blood donations remains controversial. Universal screening has been adopted in some countries after consideration of risk and resource availability. Various pathogen reduction methods have also been proposed to reduce the risk of TT-HEV. Future studies are needed to define the incidence of transmission through transfusion, their clinical features, outcomes and prognosis.},

Recent evidence has indicated the cross-species transmission of hepatitis E virus (HEV) from pigs to humans, causing zoonosis, mostly via consumption of uncooked or undercooked animal meat/viscera. In this study, we have developed a one-step RT-LAMP assay for rapid detection of swine HEV. Specific primer sets targeting the ORF3 gene were designed. The sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay was 10(1) copies/μl of RNA template, which was tenfold higher than that of RT-nPCR. The specificity of this assay was demonstrated by the lack of amplification of DNA/RNA from other swine viruses. Furthermore, a total of 41 bile samples were subjected to RT-LAMP and RT-nPCR. Eighteen positive samples were detected by RT-nPCR, while 36 positive samples were detected by RT-LAMP, indicating that the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay was higher than that of the conventional RT-nPCR assay.

	abstract = {The classification of hepatitis E virus (HEV) variants is currently in transition without agreed definitions for genotypes and subtypes or for deeper taxonomic groupings into species and genera that could incorporate more recently characterized viruses assigned to the Hepeviridae family that infect birds, bats, rodents, and fish. These conflicts arise because of differences in the viruses and genomic regions compared and in the methodology used. We have reexamined published sequences and found that synonymous substitutions were saturated in comparisons between and within virus genotypes. Analysis of complete genome sequences or concatenated ORF1/ORF2 amino acid sequences indicated that HEV variants most closely related to those infecting humans can be consistently divided into six genotypes (types 1 to 4 and two additional genotypes from wild boar). Variants isolated from rabbits, closely related to genotype 3, occupy an intermediate position. No consistent criteria could be defined for the assignment of virus subtypes. Analysis of amino acid sequences from these viruses with the more divergent variants from chickens, bats, and rodents in three conserved subgenomic regions (residues 1 to 452 or 974 to 1534 of ORF1 or residues 105 to 458 of ORF2) provided consistent support for a division into 4 groups, corresponding to HEV variants infecting humans and pigs, those infecting rats and ferrets, those from bats, and those from chickens. This approach may form the basis for a future genetic classification of HEV into four species, with the more divergent HEV-like virus from fish (cutthroat trout virus) representing a second genus.},

During the study period, we discovered two acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients infected with HEV genotype 3 and 4, respectively, and HEV RNA and/or viral proteins were persistently detected in the bone marrow of both patients. The finding suggests that HEV can replicate in human bone marrow as it may serve as a new target site and reservoir of HEV persistence.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) is emerging as the primary cause of acute viral hepatitis in humans. The virus is commonly transmitted by the fecal–oral route via contaminated water in endemic regions or through the consumption of inadequately cooked swine products or game meats in industrialized regions. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 are predominantly associated with waterborne transmission in developing countries, whereas HEV3 and HEV4 are mainly zoonotically transmitted in industrialized countries. Seroprevalence in populations determined by detecting anti-HEV antibodies and serum HEV RNA is commonly used to analyze the presence of HEV. Although HEV RNA-based detection is now standardized, there is a lack of agreement between the assaying methods used for gathering seroprevalence data. Since 2004, HEV has been considered as a transmissible infectious agent through blood transfusion. Recent seroprevalence studies in European countries indicate an underestimated risk for blood transfusion and hence warrant testing the blood supply. HEV infection is usually self-limiting and spontaneously cleared. However, in about 60\% of recipients of solid organ transplants, HEV progresses to chronic hepatitis. Immunosuppressive drugs such as tacrolimus are a major cause of chronic hepatitis and reducing its dosage results in viral clearance in about 30\% of patients. In hemodialysis patients, the parenteral route is implicated as an important mechanism of transmission. In this review, we explore the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of various HEV genotypes in blood donors, hemodialysis patients, and transplant recipients.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

HEV can cause both acute and chronic hepatitis, with the latter usually occurring in immunocompromised patients. Modes of transmission range from the classic fecal–oral route or zoonotic route, to relatively recently recognized but increasingly common routes, such as via the transfusion of blood products or organ transplantation. Extrahepatic manifestations, such as neurological, kidney and hematological abnormalities, have been documented in some limited cases, typically in patients with immune suppression. HEV has demonstrated extensive genomic diversity and a variety of HEV strains have been identified worldwide from human populations as well as growing numbers of animal species. The genetic variability and constant evolution of HEV contribute to its physiopathogenesis and adaptation to new hosts. This review describes the recent classification of the Hepeviridae family, global genotype distribution, clinical significance of HEV genotype and genomic variability and evolution of HEV.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The pathogenesis of HEV infection responsible for liver pathology and clinical disease is not well understood. The main target for the virus is the hepatocyte, where it replicates and is released to bile and gastrointestinal tract. Viremia is regularly seen during the virus replication. The exact mechanism of hepatocytic death is uncertain. In experimentally infected non-human primates, the peak of liver lesions, measured by alanine aminotransferase activity elevation, is concordant with the virus disappearance from stool at the time of dynamic humoral immune response; the role of cellular immunity has not been researched adequately, especially HEV-specific immune response in the liver. Non-human primates (chimpanzees, rhesus and cynomolgus macaques) are most widely used animal models for the study of HEV infection, its pathogenesis and vaccine trials. Several other animal models including pigs, rabbits and chickens have recently been established for the study of various aspects of HEV infection. Infectivity studies in susceptible primates were of significance in molecular studies of the virus itself. Preclinical vaccine trials with the use of various recombinant HEV capsid proteins and viral DNA established basic platform for formulation of HEV vaccine applied in HEV-endemic regions (China, Nepal). © 2011.},

In this study, based on alignment of 70 full-length HEV sequences of genotypes 1-4, a part of the ORF2/ORF3 overlapping region was found to be the best target region for PCR amplification of various HEV strains. Using the newly designed primers, an RT-PCR method (ORF2/3-137 PCR) that amplifies a 137-nucleotide (nt) sequence within the ORF2/ORF3 overlapping region and is capable of amplifying all known HEV sequences was developed. When compared with the previous RT-PCR method (ORF2-457 PCR) that amplifies a 457 nt ORF2 sequence, ORF2/3-137 PCR was two to three times more sensitive than ORF2-457 PCR upon testing serial dilutions of three HEV RNA-positive serum samples. The ORF2/3-137 PCR assay could detect viraemia in five patients with acute or fulminant hepatitis E 3-14 days longer than ORF2-457 PCR after disease onset. All 41 ORF2-457 PCR-positive serum samples of various genotypes tested positive for HEV RNA by the ORF2/3-137 PCR assay. Since the amplicons of ORF2/3-137 PCR contain variable sequences, a phylogenetic tree of the ORF2/3-137 products could clearly distinguish the different HEV genotypes.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is recognized as an emerging and often undiagnosed disease in industrialized countries, with asymptomatic infections actually occurring in blood donors. Sensitive detection of HEV-RNA is crucial for diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. We evaluated the analytical sensitivity and performance of three HEV RT-PCR assays (RealStar HEV reverse transcription-PCR [RT-PCR], hepatitis@ceeramTools, and ampliCube HEV RT-PCR) for screening of individuals for HEV infections (ID-nucleic acid amplification technology [ID-NAT]) and for blood donor pool screening (minipool-NAT [MP-NAT]). RNA was extracted using NucliSens easyMAG (ID-NAT) and a high-volume extraction protocol (4.8 ml, chemagic Viral 5K, MP-NAT). Three NAT assays were evaluated for ID-NAT but only two assays for MP-NAT due to inhibition of the ampliCube HEV RT-PCR kit using the corresponding RNA extract. Assays provided good analytical sensitivity, ranging from 37.8 to 180.1 IU/ml (ID-NAT) and from 4.7 to 91.2 IU/ml (MP-NAT). The applicability of HEV antigen (HEV-Ag) screening was compared to that of RT-PCR screening and detection of HEV-IgM antibodies using seroconversion panels of 10 HEV genotype 3-infected individuals. Four individuals revealed a positive HEV-Ag detection result, with corresponding viremias ranging from 1.92E +03 to 2.19E +05 IU/ml, while the progression of HEV-Ag followed that of HEV viremia. The other six individuals showed no presence of HEV-Ag although the corresponding viremias were also in the range of{\textgreater}1.0E +03. Anti-HEV-IgM antibodies were detectable in seven donors; one donor presented parallel positivities of HEV-Ag and anti-HEV IgM. The evaluated NAT methods present powerful tools providing sensitive HEV detection. Application of HEV-Ag or anti-HEV IgM screening is currently inferior for the early detection of HEV infection due to the decreased sensitivity compared to NAT methods.

	abstract = {Background: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a member of the Hepeviridae family; it has four main genotypes and one serotype. While genotypes 1 and 2 cause epidemic hepatitis and are transmitted via water and the fecal-oral route, genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic. In the various seroprevalence studies of hepatitis E in Brazil, the numbers reported vary widely and are difficult to interpret. The aim of this study was to analyze existing seroprevalence studies of hepatitis E in adults in Brazil. Main text: We searched the PubMed, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences and Embase databases for studies published from inception to May 12, 2018 concerning infection by HEV in Brazil without time period or language restrictions. We included studies that presented data concerning hepatitis E seroprevalence in adults in Brazil, had a sample size ≥50 patients and whose method used for the detection of anti-HEV was standardized and commercialized. We also evaluated the quality of the articles using a list of criteria that totalized 9 items. Of the 20 studies ultimately analyzed, 10 (50\%) were from the southeast region of Brazil, 3 (15\%) were from the central-west region, 3 (15\%) were from the northern region, 2 (10\%) were from the northeast region and 2 (10\%) were from the southern region. Regarding the quality evaluation of the studies, the mean score was 5.6 (range: 4-8). The estimated overall seroprevalence of HEV infection in the adult population was 6.0\% (95\% CI: 5.0-7.0); in subgroup analyses, we observed that the prevalence of anti-HEV antibodies in blood donors was 7.0\% (95\% CI: 5.0-8.0), whereas in the general population, it was 3.0\% (95\% CI: 2.0-4.0). Conclusions: The results of this systematic review indicate that there should be national investment in the prevention of hepatitis E virus infection in Brazil, including the implementation of improvements in basic sanitation and guidance regarding the appropriate handling of animal waste and the optimal cooking of vegetables, meat and their derivatives.},

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the presence of HEV in different organs and tissues of 45 apparently healthy pigs from 9 Spanish slaughterhouses (50\% National production), that could enter into the food supply chain. Anti-HEV antibodies were evaluated in serum by an ELISA test. Ten samples from each animal were analyzed for the presence of HEV RNA by a RT-qPCR. The overall seroprevalence obtained was 73.3\% (33/45). From the 450 samples analyzed a total of 26 RT-qPCR positive samples were identified in liver (7/45), faeces (6/45), kidney (5/45), heart (4/45), serum (3/45), and diaphragm (1/45). This is the first report on detection of HEV RNA in kidney and heart samples of naturally infected pigs. HEV RNA detection was negative for rib, bacon, lean ham and loin samples. These findings indicate that pig meat could be considered as a low risk material for foodborne HEV infection.},

To assess the efficacy and safety of therapy with interferon alpha we conducted a prospective study where 14 cadaveric KT recipients with chronic hepatitis C received recombinant interferon alpha-2b (IFNa) 3 million units three times weekly (scheduled) for 6 months (group A). 14 KT recipients with chronic hepatitis C were not treated and served as controls for the study period (group B). All the patients in both groups had had stable renal function for at least one year. All patients in both groups had a positive HCV viremia at the beginning of the study. Patients of group A were treated for 142 +/- 34.8 days (range 65-168); elevated serum aminotransferase (ALT) levels decreased rapidly and significantly from 100.3 +/- 48.9 to 37.7 +/- 13.9 IU/L (P = 0.001); 10 patients (77\%) were "responders," whereas the others experienced a decrease in ALT values but without reaching the normal ranges. With a mean follow-up of twelve months after discontinuation of IFNa therapy, 8 responders–i.e., 80\%–relapsed within 1-20 weeks. Only 4 patients had no detectable HCV viremia at the end of the IFNa; two of them already have abnormal values of ALT. Moreover HCV viremia was present in all patients one month after the cessation of IFNa treatment. Side effects of IFNa (fatigue, anorexia, weight loss) were frequent, and 3 patients decided to drop out of the treatment. The hematological tolerance was good although there was a significant decrease in hemoglobin (11.9 +/- 1.7 vs. 13.4 +/- 1.7 g/dl; P = 0.0044). In group B, serum ALT levels did not significantly decrease (84.2 +/- 47.6 vs. 105.2 +/- 68.8 IU/L). At the end of the study period serum ALT levels were significantly lower in group A than in group B (37.7 +/- 13.9 vs. 84.2 +/- 47.6 IU/L, P = 0.013). The major concern in group A was the occurrence of 5 renal failures. Kidney transplant biopsies showed edema, no significant tubulitis, scarcely scattered interstitial inflammatory cellular infiltration, and mesangial thickening. Four patients received methylprednisolone pulses but renal function improved in only two cases. We were not able to discover predictive factors of renal failure. We conclude that IFNa therapy is effective in controlling disease activity–i.e., reducing amino-transferase levels in KT patients with chronic hepatitis C, although relapse and detection of HCV RNA after the cessation of treatment were observed, respectively, in 80\% and 100\% of patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

To assess the efficacy and the safety of therapy with interferon alpha (IFNα) in such a population we conducted a prospective study where 16 kidney transplant recipients with chronic hepatitis C received recombinant IFNα 3 million units three times weekly scheduled for 24 consecutive weeks. All the patients had stable renal function for at least 1 year (mean serum creatinine 125.4 ± 411 μmol/l). Fifteen patients had a positive HCV viraemia at the beginning of the study. In 15 patients serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels decreased rapidly and normalized (48 ± 44 vs 98.5 ± 46 IU/l; P = 0.0044). ALT remained in the normal range as long as IFNα was continued. Serum levels of gamma glutamyl transpeptidase decreased from 129.75 ± 111.2 to 88 ± 85 IU/l; P = 0.012). After discontinuation of IFNα therapy seven responders relapsed within 1-9 weeks. HCV viraemia assessed 1 month after the end of IFNα therapy remained positive in all the patients who scored positive at the beginning, i.e. 15. Side effects of IFNα (fatigue, anorexia, weight loss) were frequent leading to four patients dropping out of the study. The haematological tolerance was moderate. The major concern was the increase in serum creatinine (162.5 ± 57.6 vs 125.4 ± 41 μmol/l; P {\textless} 0.05). In fact only six patients experienced renal failure occuring 45-168 days after the beginning of IFNα. Kidney transplant biopsies showed oedema, scarce scattered interstitial inflammatory cellular infiltration and moderate mesangial hypertrophy. Methylprednisolone pulses improved renal function in only two cases; the others had a progressive renal disease, leading one of them to haemodialysis. We conclude that IFNα therapy is effective in controlling disease activity in kidney transplant patients with hepatitis C although relapse after the cessation of treatment is common. Nevertheless the high rate of irreversible renal function impairing is unacceptable. Thus IFNα is not suitable for these patients.},

Although ribavirin can be used to treat chronic hepatitis E, toxicity in pregnant patients and the emergence of resistant strains are major concerns. Therefore there is an imminent need for effective HEV antiviral agents. The aims of this study were to develop a drug screening platform and to discover novel approaches to targeting steps within the viral life cycle. We developed a screening platform for molecules inhibiting HEV replication and selected a candidate, isocotoin. Isocotoin inhibits HEV replication through interference with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a host factor not previously known to be involved in HEV replication.

	abstract = {An efficient serum marker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is currently lacking and requires intensive exploration. We aimed to evaluate the performance of des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) for identifying hepatitis B virus-related HCC in a large, multicentre study in China. A total of 1034 subjects in three cohorts (A, B, and C) including HCC and various non-HCC controls were enrolled from 4 academic medical centers in China from January 2011 to February 2014. Blind parallel detections were conducted for DCP and AFP. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the diagnostic efficacies. In cohort A, which comprised 521 subjects, including patients with HCC, liver metastasis, liver cirrhosis (LC), and liver hemangiomas as well as healthy controls (HCs), the accuracy of DCP for distinguishing HCC from various controls was 6.2 9.7\% higher than that of AFP. In cohort B, which comprised 447 subjects, including patients with HCC, LC, and chronic hepatitis B as well as HC, the accuracy of DCP was further elevated (12.320.67\% higher than that of AFP). The superiority of DCP to AFP was more profound in the surveillance of early HCC [AUC 0.837 (95\% CI: 0.7710.903) vs. 0.650 (0.555 0.745)] and AFP-negative HCC [AUC: 0.856 (0.7980.914)] and in discriminating HCC from LC (accuracy: 92.9\%vs.64.71\%). Higher DCP levels were associated with worse clinical behaviors and shorter disease-free survival. DCP not only is complementary to AFP in identifying AFP-negative HCC and in excluding AFP-positive non-HCC (liver cirrhosis), but also demonstrates improved performance in HCC surveillance, early diagnosis, treatment response and recurrence monitoring in the HBV-related population.},

Recently, chronic hepatitis E has been described in immunosuppressed patients after solid-organ transplantation. Besides the general recommendation to lower the immunosuppressive medication in these patients, there is currently no specific treatment. We here describe the successful use of pegylated interferon alpha-2b in the treatment of 2 liver transplant recipients who suffered a chronic HEV infection for 9 years (case A) or 9 months (case B). After 4 weeks of therapy, a 2-log decrease (case A) and a 3-log decrease (case B) in the viral load were observed. In case A, who received treatment for 1 year, serum viral RNA became undetectable from week 20 onward, and serum liver enzymes normalized completely. In case B, interferon was discontinued at week 16 because of a lack of a further decline in the viral load. However, 4 weeks after the cessation of therapy, viral RNA was no longer detectable in the serum, and this was probably related to a further decline in the immunosuppressive medication. Liver tests normalized completely. In both cases, no relapse has been noted so far. We conclude that pegylated interferon alpha-2b may be useful in the treatment of chronic HEV infections in patients in whom the reduction of the immunosuppressive medication alone is not sufficient.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection can evolve to chronic hepatitis in immunocompromised patients. Pegylated α-interferon can effectively treat chronic HEV infection after liver transplantation but is contraindicated for kidney transplantation. We assessed the antiviral effect of ribavirin monotherapy in patients with chronic HEV infection following kidney transplantation. METHODS In a pilot study performed at Toulouse University Hospital, 6 patients that received kidney transplants who were positive for HEV RNA (infected with HEV for 36.5 months; [range, 11-46 months]) were given ribavirin monotherapy for 3 months. Ribavirin was given at 600-800 mg/day in 2 separate doses, based on the patient's ability to clear creatinine. RESULTS Median serum concentration of HEV RNA at baseline was 5.77 log copies/mL (range, 4.35-7.35 log copies/mL). Three months after ribavirin therapy commenced, HEV RNA was undetectable in serum samples from all patients. A sustained virologic response was observed in 4 patients; the other 2 patients relapsed at 1 and 2 months after ribavirin therapy ended. At the end of the study, all patients had normal levels of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase. Anemia was the main side effect caused by ribavirin therapy. CONCLUSIONS Ribavirin monotherapy inhibits the replication of HEV in vivo and might induce a sustained virological response in patients with chronic HEV infections. Further studies are required to determine the optimal duration of ribavirin therapy.},

However, hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection can also be acquired in industrialized countries—HEV genotype 3 infection is a zoonosis, with pigs and rodents serving as animal reservoirs. In recent years, cases of chronic HEV infection that were associated with progressive liver disease have been described in several cohorts of immunocompromised individuals, including recipients of organ transplants. The topic of hepatitis E is therefore re-emerging and has raised the following important questions: what is the risk for HEV infection in Western countries (eg, from eating uncooked meat)? How frequently does chronic hepatitis E develop among human immunodeficiency virus–infected patients and recipients of organ transplants? What are the treatment options? What is the current status of vaccine development? What do we know about the pathogenesis of HEV infection, and why does it have a more severe course in pregnant women?

Investigation of HEV replication is hampered by the lack of broadly applicable, efficient cell culture systems and tools for site-directed mutagenesis of HEV. The cell culture-adapted genotype 3c strain 47832c, which represents a typical genotype predominantly detected in Europe, has previously been used for several basic and applied research studies. Here, a plasmid-based reverse genetics system was developed for this strain, which efficiently rescued the infectious virus without the need for in vitro RNA transcription. The cotransfection of T7 RNA polymerase-expressing BSR/T7 cells with one plasmid encoding the full-length viral genome and two helper plasmids encoding vaccinia virus capping enzymes resulted in the production of infectious HEV, which could be serially passaged on A549/D3 cells. The parental and recombinant virus exhibited similar replication kinetics. A single point mutation creating an additional restriction enzyme site could be successfully introduced into the virus genome of progeny virus, indicating that the system is suitable for site-directed mutagenesis. This system is the first plasmid-based HEV reverse genetics system, as well as the first reverse genetics system for HEV genotype 3c, and should therefore be of broad use for basic and applied HEV research.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Epidemiology and clinical presentation of hepatitis E vary greatly by location and are affected by the HEV genotype. Nucleic acid amplification technique (NAT)-based assays are important for the detection of acute HEV infection as well for monitoring chronic cases of hepatitis E. Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate a panel of samples containing different genotypes of HEV for use in nucleic NAT-based assays. Study design: The panel of samples comprises eleven different members including HEV genotype 1a (2 strains), 1e, 2a, 3b, 3c, 3e, 3f, 4c, 4g as well as a human isolate related to rabbit HEV. Each laboratory assayed the panel members directly against the 1st World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard (IS) for HEV RNA (6329/10) which is based upon a genotype 3 a strain. Results: The samples for evaluation were distributed to 24 laboratories from 14 different countries and assayed on three separate days. Of these, 23 participating laboratories returned a total of 32 sets of data; 17 from quantitative assays and 15 from qualitative assays. The assays used consisted of a mixture of in-house developed and commercially available assays. The results showed that all samples were detected consistently by the majority of participants, although in some cases, some samples were detected less efficiently. Conclusions: Based on the results of the collaborative study the panel (code number 8578/13) was established as the “1st International Reference Panel (IRP) for all HEV genotypes for NAT-based assays” by the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization. This IRP will be important for assay validation and ensuring adequate detection of different genotypes and clinically important sub-genotypes of HEV.},

This retrospective European multicenter study aimed to assess the sustained virological response (SVR) in a large cohort of solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients with chronic HEV infection treated with ribavirin monotherapy (N = 255), to identify the predictive factors for SVR, and to evaluate the impact of HEV RNA mutations on virological response. METHODS Data from 255 SOT recipients with chronic HEV infection from 30 European centers were analyzed. Ribavirin was given at the median dose of 600 (range, 29-1200) mg/day (mean, 8.6 ± 3.6 mg/kg/day) for a median duration of 3 (range, 0.25-18) months. RESULTS After a first course of ribavirin, the SVR rate was 81.2\%. It increased to 89.8\% when some patients were offered a second course of ribavirin. An increased lymphocyte count at the initiation of therapy was a predictive factor for SVR, while poor hematological tolerance of ribavirin requiring its dose reduction (28\%) and blood transfusion (15.7\%) were associated with more relapse after ribavirin cessation. Pretreatment HEV polymerase mutations and de novo mutations under ribavirin did not have a negative impact on HEV clearance. Anemia was the main adverse event. CONCLUSIONS This large-scale retrospective study confirms that ribavirin is highly efficient for treating chronic HEV infection in SOT recipients and shows that the predominant HEV RNA polymerase mutations found in this study do not affect the rate of HEV clearance.This large-scale retrospective study that included 255 solid organ transplant recipients confirms that ribavirin is highly efficient for treating chronic hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection and shows that HEV RNA polymerase mutations do not play a role in HEV clearance.},

Methods: In this cross-sectional study conducted between 2007 and 2008, 465 serum samples obtained from subjects aged 1-19 years were consecutively tested to determine the prevalence of total anti-HAV antibodies. Samples were provided by a public laboratory (group 1) that serves the Unified Health System exclusively, meant to represent the lowest socioeconomic strata, and by a private laboratory (group 2), meant to represent the higher socioeconomic classes. Tests were performed at a single laboratory using commercially available electrochemiluminescence kits. Antibody levels ≥ 20 UI/L were considered positive. Results: The seroprevalence of anti-HAV in group 1 was 37.6\%. The percentage of anti-HAV reactivity increased from 19.4\% in the 1-to-4 group to 54.1\% in the 15-to-19 group. In group 2, overall anti-HAV positivity was 46.1\% and was inversely correlated with age, declining from roughly 50\% in the youngest groups to 29.1\% in the 15-to-19 group. Comparison of sample findings to those reported in a 1990s study showed a significant reduction in anti-HAV prevalence among 5-to-9-year-olds in group 1 (p = 0.03). Conclusions: The results suggest that the endemicity of hepatitis A in Porto Alegre has been declining over the past decade, and that children and adolescents, particularly those in the lowest socioeconomic strata, are more susceptible to the disease.},

A subset of these viruses infects humans and can cause a self-limiting acute hepatitis that may become chronic in immunosuppressed individuals. Current published descriptions of the taxonomical divisions within the family Hepeviridae are contradictory in relation to the assignment of species and genotypes. Through analysis of existing sequence information, we propose a taxonomic scheme in which the family is divided into the genera Orthohepevirus (all mammalian and avian hepatitis E virus (HEV) isolates) and Piscihepevirus (cutthroat trout virus). Species within the genus Orthohepevirus are designated Orthohepevirus A (isolates from human, pig, wild boar, deer, mongoose, rabbit and camel), Orthohepevirus B (isolates from chicken), Orthohepevirus C (isolates from rat, greater bandicoot, Asian musk shrew, ferret and mink) and Orthohepevirus D (isolates from bat). Proposals are also made for the designation of genotypes within the human and rat HEVs. This hierarchical system is congruent with hepevirus phylogeny, and the three classification levels (genus, species and genotype) are consistent with, and reflect discontinuities in the ranges of pairwise distances between amino acid sequences. Adoption of this system would include the avoidance of host names in taxonomic identifiers and provide a logical framework for the assignment of novel variants.},

	abstract = {The chronic course of hepatitis E virus infection in immunosuppressed patients has been recently documented; however, clinical features and factors associated with this occurrence are not well known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of previous or current HEV infection in renal transplant patients. One hundred ninety-two kidney transplant patients were studied and classified in three groups: G1-infected with hepatitis B and/or C virus; G2-patients with elevated ALT; G3-patients with normal ALT and no hepatotropic virus infection. Demographic, epidemiologic and clinical characteristics were compared between the groups. Patients with HEV infection (previous or current) were also compared to those who tested negative for HEV. HEV infection was detected using serologic (anti-HEV IgG) and molecular (HEV RNA) methods. Anti-HEV IgG was positive in 28 (15\%) while HEV RNA was positive in 20 (10\%). When both markers were considered, 44 (23\%) patients showed evidence of previous or current HEV infection. However, both markers were concomitantly positive in only four cases (2\%). In the comparative analysis, patients infected with HBV and/or HCV showed lower frequency of anti-HEV IgG (P=0.009). There was no difference regarding demographic, epidemiologic and laboratory variable between viremic and non-viremic patients. In conclusion, past and current infection with HEV was a frequent finding among renal transplant recipients. Actively infected patients (HEV RNA positive) did not present distinct demographic and epidemiological characteristics or laboratory alterations suggestive of underlying liver damage. Therefore, infection with HEV can only be detected in immunosuppressed patients by systematic investigation of HEV RNA. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Computer-assisted comparison of the nonstructural polyprotein of hepatitis E virus (HEV) with proteins of other positive-strand RNA viruses allowed the identification of the following putative functional domains: (i) RNA- dependent RNA polymerase, (ii) RNA helicase, (iii) methyltransferase, (iv) a domain of unknown function ('X' domain) flanking the papain-like protease domains in the polyproteins of animal positive-strand RNA viruses, and (v) papain-like cysteine protease domain distantly related to the putative papain-like protease of rubella virus (RubV). Comparative analysis of the polymerase and helicase sequences of positive-strand RNA viruses belonging to the so-called 'alpha-like' supergroup revealed grouping between HEV, RubV, and beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV), a plant furovirus. Two additional domains have been identified: one showed significant conservation between HEV, RubV, and BNYVV, and the other showed conservation specifically between HEV and RubV. The large nonstructural proteins of HEV, RubV, and BNYVV retained similar domain organization, with the exceptions of relocation of the putative protease domain in HEV as compared to RubV and the absence of the protease and X domains in BNYVV. These observations show that HEV, RubV, and BNYVV encompass partially conserved arrays of distinctive putative functional domains, suggesting that these viruses constitute a distinct monophyletic group within the alpha-like supergroup of positive-strand RNA viruses.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis E virus is an emerging concern in immunocompromised patients, who may become chronically infected. This prompted us to assess the performance of two anti-HEV IgG and IgM assays for diagnosing acute HEV infections. The specificities of the assays were estimated by testing samples from 2 to 3 year-old French children and blood donors and their sensitivities by testing 40 immunocompromised patients acutely infected. Both anti-HEV IgM assays were highly specific (99.6\% and 100\%). The sensitivity of the Adaltis was 87.5\%, and that of Wantai was 85\%. The specificities of anti-HEV IgG Wantai (97.8\%) and Adaltis tests (89.5\%, p= 0.1) were similar but the Wantai test was more sensitive (45\%) than the Adaltis test (15\%, p {\textless} 0.001). None of the samples was anti-HEV IgM negative and IgG positive. We conclude that these anti-HEV IgM assays performed well in immunosuppressed subjects with acute hepatitis E and can be used as first line virological tools. Testing for anti-HEV IgG and IgM simultaneously at the acute phase did not improve the diagnostic performance. In contrast, molecular detection of HEV RNA appears essential to exclude an HEV infection in patients who are negative for anti-HEV IgM and to assess the evolution of hepatitis E 3 months thereafter. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

A range of extra-hepatic manifestations of hepatitis E infection have been described, but have never been systematically studied. Aim: To report the extra-hepatic manifestations of hepatitis E virus. Methods: Retrospective review of data of 106 cases of autochthonous hepatitis E (acute n = 105, chronic n = 1). Results: Eight (7.5\%) cases presented with neurological syndromes, which included brachial neuritis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, neuromyopathy and vestibular neuritis. Patients with neurological syndromes were younger (median age 40 years, range 34-92 years, P = 0.048) and had a more modest transaminitis (median ALT 471 IU/L, P = 0.015) compared to cases without neurological symptoms [median age 64 years (range 18-88 years), median ALT 1135 IU/L]. One patient presented with a cardiac arrhythmia,twelve patients (11.3\%) presented with thrombocytopenia, fourteen (13.2\%) with lymphocytosis and eight (7.5\%) with a lymphopenia, none of which had any clinical consequence. Serum electrophoresis was performed in 65 patients at presentation, of whom 17 (26\%) had a monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance. Two cases developed haematological malignancies, acute myeloid leukaemia and duodenal plasmacytoma, 18 and 36 months after presenting with acute hepatitis E infection. Conclusions: A range of extra-hepatic manifestations can occur with hepatitis E. Neurological and haematological features of hepatitis E infection are relatively frequent in this UK cohort, and result in significant morbidity which warrants further study.},

	abstract = {In the United Kingdom, there has been an increase in the number of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections in people annually since 2010. Most of these are thought to be indigenously acquired Orthohepevirus A genotype 3 (HEV G3), which has been linked to pork production and consumption. However, the dominant subgroup circulating in British pigs differs from that which is found in people; therefore, an alternative, potentially zoonotic, source is suspected as a possible cause of these infections. Rodents, brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) in particular, have been shown to carry HEV, both the swine HEV G3 genotype and Orthohepevirus C, genotype C1 (rat HEV). To investigate the prevalence of HEV in British rodents, liver tissue was taken from 307 rodents collected from pig farms (n = 12) and other locations (n = 10). The RNA from these samples was extracted and tested using a pan-HEV nested RT-PCR. Limited histopathology was also performed. In this study, 8/61 (13\%, 95\% CI, 5–21) of brown rat livers were positive for HEV RNA. Sequencing of amplicons demonstrated all infections to be rat HEV with 87\%–92\% nucleotide identity to other rat HEV sequences circulating within Europe and China (224 nt ORF-1). Lesions and necrosis were observed histologically in 2/3 samples examined. No rat HEV RNA was detected in any other species, and no HEV G3 RNA was detected in any rodent in this study. This is the first reported detection of rat HEV in Great Britain. A human case of rat HEV infection has recently been reported in Asia, suggesting that rat HEV could pose a risk to public health.},

The aim of our study was to investigate which diagnostic test is most accurate to detect HEV infection in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients in a real world setting. Patients and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 1165 patients tested for HEV antibodies and HEV PCR at the same time point. Clinical, laboratory and virological data were taken from patient charts. HEV IgA was measured in a subgroup of 185 patients. Results: HEV RNA was detectable in 61 patients (5.2\%); most of them (n = 49, 80.3\%/n = 43, 70.5\%) were HEV IgM+ and IgG+; however, 12 patients (19.6\%) were HEV RNA positive/HEV IgM negative and 17 patients (27.8\%) were HEV RNA positive/HEV IgG negative. Ten HEV RNA positive patients (16.4\%) had neither HEV IgG nor IgM antibodies. Importantly, all of them were immunosuppressed. HEV IgA testing was less sensitive than HEV IgM for HEV diagnosis. Conclusions: HEV infection can be overlooked in patients without HEV specific antibodies. Performing PCR is necessary to diagnose or exclude HEV infection in immunocompromised hosts. In immunocompetent patients, a screening based on HEV antibodies (IgG/IgM) is sufficient.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background \& Aims Yearly, approximately 20 million people become infected with the hepatitis E virus (HEV) resulting in over 3 million cases of acute hepatitis. Although HEV-mediated hepatitis is usually self-limiting, severe cases of fulminant hepatitis as well as chronic infections have been reported, resulting annually in an estimated 60,000 deaths. We studied whether pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived hepatocytes, mesodermal and/or neuroprogenitor cells support HEV replication. Methods Human PSC were differentiated towards hepatocyte-like cells, mesodermal cells and neuroprogenitors and subsequently infected with HEV. Infection and replication of HEV was analyzed by qRT-PCR, RNA in situ hybridization, negative strand RT-PCR, production of infectious virions and transfection with a transient HEV reporter replicon. Results PSC-derived hepatocytes supported the complete replication cycle of HEV, as demonstrated by the intracellular presence of positive and negative strand HEV RNA and the production of infectious virions. The replication of the virus in these cells was inhibited by the antiviral drugs ribavirin and interferon-α2b. In contrast to PSC-derived hepatocytes, PSC-derived mesodermal cells and neuroprogenitors only supported HEV replication upon transfection with a HEV subgenomic replicon. Conclusion We demonstrate that PSC can be used to study the hepatotropism of HEV infection. The complete replication cycle of HEV can be recapitulated in infected PSC-derived hepatocytes. By contrast other germ layer cells support intracellular replication but are not infectable with HEV. Thus the early steps in the viral cycle are the main determinant governing HEV tissue tropism. PSC-hepatocytes offer a physiological relevant tool to study the biology of HEV infection and replication and may aid in the design of therapeutic strategies.},

Several studies have demonstrated the relationship among human and animals strains, mostly pigs and deers, from respective areas characterizing zoonosis. Circulation of genotype 3 of HEV in Brazilian swine herds have already been demonstrated. Nevertheless, no confirmed human cases have been reported to date in Brazil. OBJECTIVES A study was developed to attempt the identification of hepatitis E acute cases in Brazil. STUDY DESIGN A retrospective study carried out with 64 serum samples from patients with acute non-A–C hepatitis was performed to identify human cases of acute hepatitis E. RESULTS We could identify a confirmed case of acute hepatitis E. The patient seroconverted to hepatitis E virus-specific IgM and IgG antibody, HEV-RNA was amplified from serum, and the analysis of the sequence of a 242 nucleotide fragment from the ORF1 genome region classified the strain within genotype 3 and subgenotype 3b. Investigation of risk factors and results from phylogenetic analysis suggested a likely zoonotic origin for the infection.

	abstract = {Hepatitis E is a rare human disease in developed countries. It is caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV), which is probably transmitted zoonotically to humans from domestic pigs and wild boars. Multiple reports on the detection of HEV-specific antibodies in rats have suggested the presence of an HEV-related agent; however, infectious virus or a viral genome has not been demonstrated so far. Here, a nested broad-spectrum RT-PCR protocol was developed capable of detecting different HEV types including those derived from wild boar and chicken. Screening of 30 faecal samples from wild Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) from Hamburg (Germany) resulted in the detection of two sequences with similarities to human, mammalian and avian HEV. Virus particles with a morphology reminiscent of HEV were demonstrated by immunoelectron microscopy in one of these samples and the virus was tentatively designated rat HEV. Genome fragments with sizes of 4019 and 1545 nt were amplified from two samples. Sequence comparison with human and avian strains revealed only 59.9 and 49.9\% sequence identity, respectively. Similarly, the deduced amino acid sequence for the complete capsid protein had 56.2 and 42.9\% identity with human and avian strains, respectively. Inoculation of the samples onto three different permanent rat liver cell lines did not result in detectable virus replication as assayed by RT-PCR with cells of the fifth virus passage. Further investigations are necessary to clarify the zoonotic potential of rat HEV and to assess its suitability to serve in a laboratory rat animal model for human hepatitis E. © 2010 SGM.},

However, the global burden of HEV outbreak has not been comprehensively described. We performed a systematic review of confirmed HEV outbreaks based on published literatures. HEV outbreaks have mainly been reported from Asian and African countries, and only a few from European and American countries. India represents a country with the highest number of reported HEV outbreaks. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 were responsible for most of the large outbreaks in developing countries. During the outbreaks in developing countries, a significantly higher case fatality rate was observed in pregnant women. In fact, outbreaks have occurred both in open and closed populations. The control measures mainly depend upon improvement of sanitation and hygiene. This study highlights that HEV outbreak is not new, yet it is a continuous global health problem.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection has been identified as a cause of graft hepatitis in liver transplant recipients. The true frequency and clinical importance of HEV infections after liver transplantations is a matter of debate. It is proposed that consumption of HEV-contaminated undercooked meat is a main source for HEV infections in developed countries – which might also account for some hepatitis E cases after organ transplantation. However, HEV is also transmitted by transfusion of blood products, likely representing a previously underestimated risk particularly for patients in the transplant setting. HEV infection can take chronic courses in immunocompromised individuals, associated in some cases with rapid progression to cirrhosis within 1–2years of infection. Diagnosis in transplanted patients is based on HEV RNA testing as antibody assays are not sensitive enough. Selection of immunosuppressive drugs is important as different compounds may influence viral replication and the course of liver disease. Ribavirin has antiviral activity against HEV and should be administered for at least three months in chronically infected individuals; however, treatment failure may occur. HEV infections have also been linked to a variety of extrahepatic manifestations both during and after resolution of infection. In this review we summarize the emerging data on hepatitis E with a particular focus on the importance of HEV infections for liver transplant recipients.},

	abstract = {Acute hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is a leading cause of acute liver failure (ALF) in many developing countries, yet rarely identified in Western countries. Given that antibody testing for HEV infection is not routinely obtained, we hypothesized that HEV-related ALF might be present and unrecognized in North American ALF patients. Serum samples of 681 adults enrolled in the U.S. Acute Liver Failure Study Group were tested for anti-HEV immunoglobulin (Ig) M and anti-HEV IgG levels. Subjects with a detectable anti-HEV IgM also underwent testing for HEV RNA. Mean patient age was 41.8 years, 32.9\% were male, and ALF etiologies included acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity (29\%), indeterminate ALF (23\%), idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury DILI (22\%), acute hepatitis B virus infection (12\%), autoimmune hepatitis (12\%), and pregnancy-related ALF (2\%). Three men ages 36, 39, and 70 demonstrated repeatedly detectable anti-HEV IgM, but all were HEV-RNA negative and had other putative diagnoses. The latter 2 subjects died within 3 and 11 days of enrollment whereas the 36-year-old underwent emergency liver transplantation on study day 2. At admission, 294 (43.4\%) of the ALF patients were anti-HEV IgG positive with the seroprevalence being highest in those from the Midwest (50\%) and lowest in those from the Southeast (28\%). Anti-HEV IgG+ subjects were significantly older, less likely to have APAP overdose, and had a lower overall 3-week survival compared to anti-HEV IgG- subjects (63\% vs. 70\%; P = 0.018). Conclusion: Acute HEV infection is very rare in adult Americans with ALF (i.e., 0.4\%) and could not be implicated in any indeterminate, autoimmune, or pregnancy-related ALF cases. Past exposure to HEV with detectable anti-HEV IgG was significantly more common in the ALF patients compared to the general U.S. population. (Hepatology 2016;64:1870-1880).},

Seroprevalence is approximately 15\% in developed countries, and 22\% in France. hepatitis E virus (HEV) can be transmitted via transfusions and therefore possibly intravenous (IV) drug use. Hepatitis E serology is routinely tested in patients who seek medical advice for addictive injection behavior at the addiction treatment, support and prevention unit of Toulouse University Hospital. We assume that hepatitis E is more prevalent in patients presenting with addictive injection behavior than in the general French population. Methods: Hepatitis E serological assays [immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG] were carried out for all patients presenting with addictive injection behavior during an initial evaluation. The controls were taken from a cohort of 3,353 blood donors living in southern France and who donated blood during the first 2 weeks of October 2011. Results: We included 52 patients presenting with addictive injection behavior and 103 healthy controls matched for age, sex, and area of residence. We found no difference between patients and controls for the prevalence of hepatitis E: patients vs. healthy controls: positive IgGs: 42.31\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI) (28.73–56.80\%) vs. 43.43\%, 95\% CI (33.50–53.77\%) (p = 0.89) and positive IgMs: 3.85\%, 95\% CI (0.47–13.22\%) vs. 4.85\%, 95\% CI (0.16–10.97\%) (p = 0.57). Conclusion: There was no difference in HEV seroprevalence between IV drug users and the general population, suggesting that the IV route of HEV infection is not significant in this population.},

	abstract = {Background With recent improvements in vaccines and treatments against viral hepatitis, an improved understanding of the burden of viral hepatitis is needed to inform global intervention strategies. We used data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study to estimate morbidity and mortality for acute viral hepatitis, and for cirrhosis and liver cancer caused by viral hepatitis, by age, sex, and country from 1990 to 2013. Methods We estimated mortality using natural history models for acute hepatitis infections and GBD's cause-of-death ensemble model for cirrhosis and liver cancer. We used meta-regression to estimate total cirrhosis and total liver cancer prevalence, as well as the proportion of cirrhosis and liver cancer attributable to each cause. We then estimated cause-specific prevalence as the product of the total prevalence and the proportion attributable to a specific cause. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were calculated as the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). Findings Between 1990 and 2013, global viral hepatitis deaths increased from 0·89 million (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 0·86–0·94) to 1·45 million (1·38–1·54); YLLs from 31·0 million (29·6–32·6) to 41·6 million (39·1–44·7); YLDs from 0·65 million (0·45–0·89) to 0·87 million (0·61–1·18); and DALYs from 31·7 million (30·2–33·3) to 42·5 million (39·9–45·6). In 2013, viral hepatitis was the seventh (95\% UI seventh to eighth) leading cause of death worldwide, compared with tenth (tenth to 12th) in 1990. Interpretation Viral hepatitis is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Unlike most communicable diseases, the absolute burden and relative rank of viral hepatitis increased between 1990 and 2013. The enormous health loss attributable to viral hepatitis, and the availability of effective vaccines and treatments, suggests an important opportunity to improve public health.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Every year, there are an estimated 20 million hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections worldwide, leading to an estimated 3.3 million symptomatic cases of hepatitis E. HEV is largely circulating in the west and is associated with several hepatic and extrahepatic diseases. HEV Genotype 1 and 2 infections are waterborne and causative for epidemics in the tropics, while genotype 3 and 4 infections are zoonotic diseases and are mainly transmitted by ingestion of undercooked pork in industrialized nations. The clinical course of these infections differs: genotype 1 and 2 infection can cause acute illness and can lead to acute liver failure (ALF) or acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) with a high mortality rate of 20\% in pregnant women. In contrast, the majority of HEV GT-3 and -4 infections have a clinically asymptomatic course and only rarely lead to acute on chronic liver failure in elderly or patients with underlying liver disease. Immunosuppressed individuals infected with genotype 3 or 4 may develop chronic hepatitis E, which then can lead to life-threatening cirrhosis. Furthermore, several extra-hepatic manifestations affecting various organs have been associated with ongoing or previous HEV infections but the causal link for many of them still needs to be proven. There is no approved specific therapy for the treatment of acute or chronic HEV GT-3 or -4 infections but off-label use of ribavirin has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in the majority of patients. However, in approximately 15\% of chronically HEV infected patients, cure is not possible.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Four different genotypes of swine HEV within the species Orthohepevirus A have been identified so far from domesticated and wild swine population: genotypes 3 (HEV-3) and 4 (HEV-4) swine HEVs are zoonotic and infect humans, whereas HEV-5 and HEV-6 are only identified from swine. As a zoonotic agent, swine HEV is an emerging public health concern in many industrialized countries. Pigs are natural reservoir for HEV, consumption of raw or undercooked pork is an important route of foodborne HEV transmission. Occupational risks such as direct contact with infected pigs also increase the risk of HEV transmission in humans. Cross-species infection of HEV-3 and HEV-4 have been documented under experimental and natural conditions. Both swine HEV-3 and swine HEV-4 infect non-human primates, the surrogates of man. Swine HEV, predominantly HEV-3, can establish chronic infection in immunocompromised patients especially in solid organ transplant recipients. The zoonotic HEV-3, and to lesser extent HEV-4, have also been shown to cause neurological diseases and kidney injury. In this review, we focus on the epidemiology of swine HEV, host and viral determinants influencing cross-species HEV infection, zoonotic infection and its associated pork safety concern, as well as swine HEV-associated chronic infection and neurological diseases.},

Hepatitis E is an enterically transmitted zoonotic disease that causes large waterborne epidemic outbreaks in developing countries and has become an increasing public-health concern in industrialized countries. In this setting, the infection is usually acute and self-limiting in immunocompetent individuals, although chronic cases in immunocompromised patients have been reported, frequently associated with several extrahepatic manifestations. Moreover, extrahepatic manifestations have also been reported in immunocompetent individuals with acute HEV infection. HEV belongs to the alphavirus-like supergroup III of single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses, and its genome contains three partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes a nonstructural protein with eight domains, most of which have not been extensively characterized: methyltransferase, Y domain, papain-like cysteine protease, hypervariable region, proline-rich region, X domain, Hel domain, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. ORF2 and ORF3 encode the capsid protein and a multifunctional protein believed to be involved in virion release, respectively. The novel ORF4 is only expressed in HEV genotype 1 under endoplasmic reticulum stress conditions, and its exact function has not yet been elucidated. Despite important advances in recent years, the biological and molecular processes underlying HEV replication remain poorly understood, primarily due to a lack of detailed information about the functions of the viral proteins and the mechanisms involved in host-pathogen interactions. This review summarizes the current knowledge concerning HEV proteins and their biological properties, providing updated detailed data describing their function and focusing in detail on their structural characteristics. Furthermore, we review some unclear aspects of the four proteins encoded by the ORFs, highlighting the current key information gaps and discussing potential novel experimental strategies for shedding light on those issues.},

In addition to humans, strains of HEV have been genetically identified from pig, chicken, rat, mongoose, deer, rabbit and fish. While the genotypes 1 and 2 HEV are restricted to humans, the genotypes 3 and 4 HEV are zoonotic and infect humans and other animal species. As a part of our ongoing efforts to search for potential animal reservoirs for HEV, we tested goats from Virginia for evidence of HEV infection and showed that 16\% (13/80) of goat sera from Virginia herds were positive for IgG anti-HEV. Importantly, we demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies to HEV were present in selected IgG anti-HEV positive goat sera. Subsequently, in an attempt to genetically identify the HEV-related agent from goats, we conducted a prospective study in a closed goat herd with known anti-HEV seropositivity and monitored a total of 11 kids from the time of birth until 14 weeks of age for evidence of HEV infection. Seroconversion to IgG anti-HEV was detected in seven of the 11 kids, although repeated attempts to detect HEV RNA by a broad-spectrum nested RT-PCR from the faecal and serum samples of the goats that had seroconverted were unsuccessful. In addition, we also attempted to experimentally infect laboratory goats with three well-characterized mammalian strains of HEV but with no success. The results indicate that a HEV-related agent is circulating and maintained in the goat population in Virginia and that the goat HEV is likely genetically very divergent from the known HEV strains. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The seroprevalence of hepatitis E virus (HEV) in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) is little known in Brazil. Studies have suggested that HEV may harmfully influence the course of CLD, with a higher risk of progression to cirrhosis. Objective: To estimate the prevalence of the anti-HEV antibody (IgG) in patients with CLD and to describe demographic data and risk factors, as well as clinical-laboratory and ultrasound parameters. Patients and methods: Cross-sectional study that included 227 patients with CLD followed at a referral outpatient clinic from June 2022 to March 2023. The patients were investigated clinically and tested for liver functions, anti-HEV IgG and, in positive cases, for HEV-RNA. Ultrasonography of the upper abdomen was also carried out. Results: Investigation of 227 patients (50 with hepatitis B, 49 with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, 33 with hepatitis C, 17 with alcoholic liver disease, 16 with schistosomiasis and 62 with mixed disease), 55.5\% were female, with an average age of 57 ± 13 years; 37.9\% had liver cirrhosis. Seven patients (3.08\%) presented anti-HEV positive and HEV-RNA negative. Ultrasound identified association between anti-HEV and contact with pigs, presence of gynecomastia or palmar erythema, lower platelet count, higher APRI and FIB-4 values, and splenomegaly. Conclusion: Although the prevalence of anti-HEV in patients with CLD was low in this study, the antibody was observed more frequently in cases with a history of contact with pigs and with clinical-laboratory or imaging evidence of more advanced chronic liver disease.},

	abstract = {Objective: Viral hepatitis A (HAV) and E (HEV) infections are still frequent in many regions of the world, particularly in developing countries where sanitary conditions and socioeconomic level are frequently low. In this work, we have studied seroprevalences of these two infections in Tunisian children, teenagers and young adults. Material and methods: The studied population included 3357 individuals from different regions of Tunisia and distributed in three groups 1 (n = 1145), 2 (n = 707) and 3 (n = 1505) with a mean of age of 6.94, 12.84 and 20.71 years, respectively. Results: Rates of HAV infection prevalence of 84.0, 90.5 and 91.7\% were found within groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. These rates are lower than those previously found in the country; thus, primary infection with HAV in Tunisia is progressively shifting to older ages, which is probably due to the improvement of sanitary conditions. Lower anti-HAV prevalences were found in costal regions as compared to the rest of the country. This difference may be due to the higher socioeconomic level of the population living in costal regions. Antibodies against HEV were assessed in individuals of group 3. A seroprevalence of 4.3\% was found which indicates that, despite the absence of epidemics, the virus is circulating among the Tunisian population as sporadic cases. Conclusion: The present work contributes to a better knowledge of HAV and HEV infections in Tunisia and highlights the need of the establishment of a national program for virological surveillance of hepatitis cases and of further studies to monitor changes in the epidemiology of these infections. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

	abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the causative agent of hepatitis E in humans and the leading cause for acute viral hepatitis worldwide. The virus is classified as a member of the genus Orthohepevirus A within the Hepeviridae family. Due to the absence of a robust cell culture model for HEV infection, the analysis of the viral life cycle, the development of effective antivirals and a vaccine is severely limited. In this study, we established a protocol based on the HEV genotype 3 p6 (Kernow C-1) and the human hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and HepG2/C3A with different media conditions to produce intracellular HEV cell culturederived particles (HEVcc)with viral titers between 105 and 106 FFU/mL. Viral titers could be further enhanced by an HEV variant harboring a mutation in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. These HEVcc particles were characterized in density gradients and allowed the trans-complementation of subgenomic reporter HEV replicons. In addition, in vitro produced intracellular-derived particles were infectious in liver-humanized mice with high RNA copy numbers detectable in serum and feces. Efficient infection of primary human and swine hepatocytes using the developed protocol could be observed and was inhibited by ribavirin. Finally, RNA sequencing studies of HEV-infected primary human hepatocytes demonstrated a temporally structured transcriptional defense response. In conclusion, this robust cell culture model of HEV infection provides a powerful tool for studying viral-host interactions that should facilitate the discovery of antiviral drugs for this important zoonotic pathogen.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis E is an acute hepatitis casused by hepatitis E virus (HEV) in developing countries, where it occurs as cases sporadic and in epidemics form. The causative agent, hepatitis E virus, is transmitted primarily by the fecal-oral route. HEV is icosahedron non-enveloped virus, and its genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense, 3'-polyadenylated RNA about 7.5 kb in length. It contains three open reading frames (ORFs). Of which ORF1 codes for a polyprotein of 1693 amino acids and contain domains homologous to a viral methyltransferase, a papainlike cysteine protease, an RNA helicasre, and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, besides the most hypervariable region of the HEV genome. And ORF3 codes for a 123-amino-acide-long polypeptide with unknown function. While the major viral capsid protein (pORF2, ORF2 codes) of 660 amino acid was showed to contain the protective epitope. The bacterially expressed polypeptide disignated as NE2 has been proved to be a protective antige. And the anti-NE2 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) was screend, two of these mAbs 8C11 and 8H3 were showed to be against separate conformational neutralization epitope of hepatitis E virus (HEV). And these two mAb were used to screen for binding peptides from a 7-peptides phage display library. After four rounds of panning, tweenty-one positive monoclonal phages (11 for 8C11, and 10 for 8H3) were selected and the inserted fragments were sequenced. The DNA sequence coding for the obtained dominant peptide 8C11 (N'-His-Pro-Thr-Leu-Leu-Arg-Ile-C', named 8C11A) and 8H3 (N'-Ser-Ile-Leu-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Tyr-C', named 8H3A) were then synthesized and cloned to insert between amino acid 78 to 83 of hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg), then expressed in E. coli. The recombinant proteins aggregate into homodimer or polymer on SDS-PAGE, and could bind with mAb 8C11 and 8H3 in Western blotting. Respectively, the recombinant protein C8C11A showed to be dimer mainly, which can bind with mAb 8C11. The monomer and dimer of C8H3A are in the same amount on SDS-PAGE, but only the dimer could bind with mAb 8H3 on Western blotting. The renatured recombinant proteins were all showed to aggregate into virus like particles which were similar as HBcAg on transmission electron micrograph. The dominant peptide 8H3A (N'-Ser-Ile-Leu-Pro-Tyr-ProTyr-C') that selected out by mAb 8H3 was further chemo-synthesized, and its binding activity was confirmed by BIAcore biosensor. The result showed that this 7-peptide can bind with mAb 8H3 in a big Ka and Kd form, which means the binding is not stable. These results implicated that conformational dependent neutralization epitope could be partially modeled by short peptide, which provided a feasible route for subunit vaccine development.},

HEV was previously considered to be restricted to resource-limited countries with poor sanitary conditions, but increasing evidence implies that HEV is also a public health problem in developed countries and regions. Fortunately, several vaccine candidates based on virus-like particles (VLPs) have progressed into the clinical development stage, and one of them has been approved in China. This review provides an overview of the current HEV vaccine pipeline and future development with the emphasis on defining the critical quality attributes for the well-characterized vaccines. The presence of clinically relevant epitopes on the VLP surface is critical for eliciting functional antibodies against HEV infection, which is the key to the mechanism of action of the prophylactic vaccines against viral infections. Therefore, the epitope-specific immunochemical assays based on monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for HEV vaccine antigen are critical methods in the toolbox for epitope characterization and for in vitro potency assessment. Moreover, serological evaluation methods after immunization are also discussed as biomarkers for clinical performance. The vaccine efficacy surrogate assays are critical in the preclinical and clinical stages of VLP-based vaccine development.},

	abstract = {Assessing and responding to health risk of climate change is important because of its impact on the natural and societal ecosystems. More frequent and severe flood events will occur in China due to climate change. Given that population is projected to increase, more people will be vulnerable to flood events, which may lead to an increased incidence of HAV infection in the future. This population-based study is going to project the future health burden of HAV infection associated with flood events in Huai River Basin of China. The study area covered four cities of Anhui province in China, where flood events were frequent. Time-series adjusted Poisson regression model was developed to quantify the risks of flood events on HAV infection based on the number of daily cases during summer seasons from 2005 to 2010, controlling for other meteorological variables. Projections of HAV infection in 2020 and 2030 were estimated based on the scenarios of flood events and demographic data. Poisson regression model suggested that compared with the periods without flood events, the risks of severe flood events for HAV infection were significant (OR = 1.28, 95 \% CI 1.05–1.55), while risks were not significant from moderate flood events (OR = 1.16, 95 \% CI 0.72–1.87) and mild flood events (OR = 1.14, 95 \% CI 0.87–1.48). Using the 2010 baseline data and the flood event scenarios (one severe flood event), increased incidence of HAV infection were estimated to be between 0.126/105 and 0.127/105 for 2020. Similarly, the increased HAV infection incidence for 2030 was projected to be between 0.382/105 and 0.399/105. Our study has, for the first time, quantified the increased incidence of HAV infection that will result from flood events in Anhui, China, in 2020 and 2030. The results have implications for public health preparation for developing public health responses to reduce HAV infection during future flood events.},

All 11 patients had detectable HEV RNA in serum at admission, with the highest viral load being 1.9 × 103 to 1.7 × 107 copies/ml, and HEV viremia lasted until days 17 to 48 (mean, 28.3) after the onset of hepatitis. Even at the initial examination on days 10 to 29 (mean, 17.6), the HEV load in fecal supernatant was less than 5.7 × 104 copies/ml for 10 of the 11 patients, while for the remaining patient (patient 1) it was markedly high, 2.0 × 107 copies/ml on day 22. In addition, although HEV RNA in fecal supernatant continued to be positive until days 14 to 33 (mean, 22.4) for patients 2 to 11, that for patient 1 was detectable even on day 121. HEVs in fecal specimens obtained on days 22, 24, 26, 28, and 30, but not day 121, from patient 1 grew efficiently in PLC/PRF/5 cells, reaching the highest titer of up to 107 copies/ml in culture medium on day 50 postinoculation. The HEV genome recovered from patient 1 had 29 unique nucleotides that were not seen in any of the 25 reported HEV isolates of the same genotype over the entire genome, with six amino acid substitutions in the ORF1 protein.

The purified IgM was used to develop a solid-phase radioimmunoassay (SPRIA) in which IgM was used as capture antibody and iodinated IgM was used as a probe.

It is generally accepted that AIS is a multifactorial disease controlled by genetic, hormonal, neuromuscular, and environmental factors. Herein, we describe a case of 12‑year‑old scoliotic girl with a double curve of initially 26° thoracic and 23° lumbar, seeking chiropractic care. The therapy was provided three times/twice a week for 6 months. Adjustments of the spine through chiropractic, both soreness and mobility, were shown to improve. A total correction in Cobb angle of 6° (23\%) in the thoracic curve and 7° (30\%) in the lumbar curve was illustrated on consequent radiographs. This case highlights the advantage of chiropractic adjustment of early scoliosis primarily because the medical community does not offer any treatment for such a mild scoliosis. Further, randomized trial is warranted to support this viability for AIS. Keywords:},

	abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is endemic in many developing and some industrialized countries. It has been hypothesized that animals may be the source of infection. The recent identification of swine HEV in U.S. pigs and the demonstration of its ability to infect across species have lent credence to this hypothesis. To assess the potential risk of zoonotic HEV infection, we tested a total of 468 veterinarians working with swine (including 389 U.S. swine veterinarians) and 400 normal U.S. blood donors for immunoglobulin G anti-HEV. Recombinant capsid antigens from a U.S. strain of swine HEV and from a human HEV strain (Sar-55) were each used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The anti-HEV prevalence assayed with the swine HEV antigen showed 97\% concordance with that obtained with the human HEV antigen (κ = 92\%). Among the 295 swine veterinarians tested from the eight U.S. states (Minnesota, Indiana, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, and Alabama) from which normal blood donor samples were available, 26\% were positive with Sar-55 antigen and 23\% were positive with swine HEV antigen. In contrast, 18\% of the blood donors from the same eight U.S. states were positive with Sar-55 antigen and 17\% were positive with swine HEV antigen. Swine veterinarians in the eight states were 1.51 times more likely when tested with swine HEV antigen (95\% confidence interval, 1.03 to 2.20) and 1.46 times more likely when tested with Sar-55 antigen (95\% confidence interval, 0.99 to 2.17) to be anti-HEV positive than normal blood donors. We did not find a difference in anti-HEV prevalence between veterinarians who reported having had a needle stick or cut and those who had not or between those who spent more time (≥80\% of the time) and those who spent less time (≤20\% of the time) working with pigs. Similarly, we did not find a difference in anti-HEV prevalence according to four job categories (academic, practicing, student, and industry veterinarians). There was a difference in anti-HEV prevalence in both swine veterinarians and blood donors among the eight selected states, with subjects from Minnesota six times more likely to be anti-HEV positive than those from Alabama. Age was not a factor in the observed differences from state to state. Anti-HEV prevalence in swine veterinarians and normal blood donors was age specific and paralleled increasing age. The results suggest that swine veterinarians may be at somewhat higher risk of HEV infection than are normal …},

The presence of chronic HEV infection was also investigated. Methods: A cohort study was conducted among 316 KTR treated at a referral center for kidney transplantation in Goiânia, Brazil. All serum samples were tested for the presence of HEV RNA (real-time PCR) and anti-HEV IgG/IgM (ELISA). Anti-HEV-positive samples were confirmed using an immunoblot test. HEV chronicity was investigated in a subgroup of patients with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT {\textgreater}40 IU/l) through HEV RNA detection in additional serum samples collected 3 and 6 months apart. Results: A seroprevalence of 2.5\% (95\% confidence interval 1.2–5.1\%) was found for anti-HEV IgG. There was no difference in characteristics between the anti-HEV IgG seropositive and seronegative KTR groups. Anti-HEV IgM was detected in only one patient (0.3\%). All KTR were negative for HEV RNA. Conclusions: These results show that HEV infection is infrequent in KTR in Central Brazil, with low seroprevalence rates of past and recent infection, and also an absence of active and chronic HEV infections.},

This study demonstrated the HEV seroprevalence and incidence of HEV infection in patients with clinical hepatitis in a tertiary hospital in Thailand. Methods: A laboratory-based cross-sectional study was conducted using 1106 serum samples from patients suspected of HEV infection sent to the Serology laboratory, Siriraj Hospital, for detecting HEV antibodies during 2015–2018. Prevalence of anti-HEV IgG and IgM antibodies in general patients, including organ transplant recipients and pregnant women in a hospital setting, were determined using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Comparison of laboratory data between groups with different HEV serological statuses was performed. Results: HEV IgG antibodies were detected in 40.82\% of 904 serum samples, while HEV IgM antibodies were detected in 11.75\% of 1081 serum samples. Similar IgG and IgM antibody detection rates were found in pregnant women. Interestingly, anti-HEV IgM antibodies were detected in 38.5\% of patients who underwent organ transplantation. Patients who tested positive for anti-HEV IgM antibodies had higher alanine aminotransferase levels than those who had not. In contrast, patients who tested positive for anti-HEV IgG had more elevated levels of total bilirubin than those who tested negative. Conclusions: HEV seroprevalence and incidence in patients with clinical hepatitis were relatively high in the Thai population, including the pregnancy and organ transplant subgroups. The results potentially benefit the clinicians in decision-making to investigate HEV antibodies and facilitating proper management for patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotype 3 and 4 can cause liver disease in human and has its main reservoir in pigs. HEV investigations in pigs worldwide have been performed but there is still a lack of information on the infection dynamics in pig populations. Findings. The HEV transmission dynamics in commercial pig farms in six different European countries was studied. The data collected show prevalence in weaners ranging from 8\% to 30\%. The average HEV prevalence in growers was between 20\% and 44\%. The fatteners prevalence ranged between 8\% and 73\%. Sows prevalence was similar in all countries. Boar faeces were tested for HEV only in Spain and Czech Republic, and the prevalence was 4.3\% and 3.5\% respectively. The collected data sets were analyzed using a recently developed model to estimate the transmission dynamics of HEV in the different countries confirming that HEV is endemic in pig farms. Conclusions: This study has been performed using similar detection methods (real time RT-PCR) for all samples and the same model (SIR model) to analyse the data. Furthermore, it describes HEV prevalence and within-herd transmission dynamics in European Countries (EU): Czech Republic, Italy, Portugal, Spain, The Netherlands and United Kingdom, confirming that HEV is circulating in pig farms from weaners to fatteners and that the reproductive number mathematical defined as R 0 is in the same range for all countries studied. © 2012 Berto et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Clinical records were reviewed for the type of immunosuppressant used, treatment duration, liver function tests and viral markers before, during and after each immunosuppressant. Logistic and Cox regression analysis were used to identify predictors of outcome. RESULTS 162 patients were included; 104 had HBV markers (25 HBsAg positive) and 74 had HCV markers (51 HCV-RNA positive), and 16 patients had markers of both infections. Liver dysfunction was observed in 9 of 25 HBsAg positive patients (36\%), 6 of whom developed hepatic failure. Liver dysfunction in HCV was observed in 8 of 51 HCV-RNA positive patients (15.7\%), and only one developed hepatic failure. The frequency and severity of liver dysfunction was significantly higher in HBV-infected patients than in HCV-infected patients (p=0.045 and p=0.049, respectively). Treatment with ≥2 immunosuppressants was an independent predictor of HBV reactivation (OR 8.75; 95\% CI 1.16 to 65.66). The majority of patients without reactivation received only one immunosuppressant for a short period and/or prophylactic antiviral treatment. No definite HBV reactivations were found in anti-HBc positive patients lacking HBsAg. CONCLUSION Liver dysfunction in patients with IBD treated with immunosuppressants is more frequent and severe in those with HBV than in HCV carriers and is associated with combined immunosuppression.},

Paucity of data on asymptomatic viremia in blood donors and higher incidence of Hepatitis E in haemodialysis patients and thalassemics mandate a prospective study of blood recipients to elucidate the exact incidence and natural history of post transfusion Hepatitis E. Methods: A total of 2000 recipients of blood or blood products transfusion were followed up for two months to detect development of post transfusion Hepatitis E, by clinical examination, transaminases and immunoglobulin M anti hepatitis E virus (IgM anti HEV). Estimation of hepatitis E virus ribonucleic acid (HEV RNA) was done in patients with elevated levels of transaminases. Result: Out of 2000 patients, 5(0.25\%) were positive for IgM anti HEV at the time of transfusion and were excluded from the study. Rest of 1995 patients were followed up for two months post transfusion. A total of 1303 (65.3\%) patients were followed up for two months and 1636 (82.0\%) patients at least once in two visits. None of the followed up patients reported development of jaundice or had clinically evident hepatitis, although 62 patients had raised transaminases detected at either one or both the visits. Conclusion: All followed up patients were tested for IgM anti HEV at both the visits and none were found to be positive. Patients with raised transaminases were subjected to HEV RNA and all were found to be negative.},

Only a few strains have been characterized to date from cases of hepatitis E in Spain. Using three sets of new, HEV-specific primers, viral genome fragments were amplified from serum samples from 13 patients with acute hepatitis in different regions of Spain. Direct sequencing of these fragments and analysis of sequences lead to identify six genotype 1, six genotype 3, and one genotype 4 viral strains. Genotype 1 sequences were found in the clade with subtype 1a strains, and were amplified from travelers from India and Bangladesh, and from an African immigrant. Genotype 3 sequences were found in the clade with subtype 3f strains, were always amplified from patients who did not travel abroad recently, and were closely related to sequences from swine strains isolated in Spain. Patients infected by these strains lived in different regions and were mainly men aged above 50 years. The single genotype 4 sequence detected was amplified from a traveler returning from Vietnam. Hepatitis E is both an imported and an autochthonous disease in Spain, and closely related HEV genotype 3f strains are responsible for infections acquired locally in different regions of the country within a given time. Studies involving a significant number of human, swine, and environmental viral strains collected prospectively are, however, required in order to confirm a swine origin for autochthonous HEV genotype 3 human infections. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {The hepatitis E virus (HEV) ORF2 encodes a single structural capsid protein. The E2s domain (amino acids 459-606) of the capsid protein has been identified as the major immune target. All identified neutralizing epitopes are located on this domain; however, a comprehensive characterization of antigenic sites on the domain is lacking due to its high degree of conformation dependence. Here, we used the statistical software SPSS to analyze cELISA (competitive ELISA) data to classify monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which recognized conformational epitopes on E2s domain. Using this novel analysis method, we identified various conformational mAbs that recognized the E2s domain. These mAbs were distributed into 6 independent groups, suggesting the presence of at least 6 epitopes. Twelve representative mAbs covering the six groups were selected as a tool box to further map functional antigenic sites on the E2s domain. By combining functional and location information of the 12 representative mAbs, this study provided a complete picture of potential neutralizing epitope regions and immune-dominant determinants on E2s domain. One epitope region is located on top of the E2s domain close to the monomer interface; the other is located on the monomer side of the E2s dimer around the groove zone. Besides, two non-neutralizing epitopes were also identified on E2s domain that did not stimulate neutralizing antibodies. Our results help further the understanding of protective mechanisms induced by the HEV vaccine. Furthermore, the tool box with 12 representative mAbs will be useful for studying the HEV infection process.},

The currently commercially available HEV-specific enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are primarily designed for the detection of antibodies against genotypes 1 (Burma) and 2 (Mexico) and may not sensitively detect HEV genotypes 3 or 4. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to evaluate the analytical and clinical performances of eight commercially available HEV serum antibody immunoglobulin M (IgM)- and immunoglobulin G (IgG)-specific ELISAs for genotype 1 and 3 HEV infections in a clinical setting and to study the antibody responses against HEV of immunocompromised versus immunocompetent patient groups. STUDY DESIGN Analytical performance and diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were assessed using well-defined reference samples and samples from patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed HEV infection (n=88) and a specificity panel (n=98). RESULTS Limiting dilutions indicated that the highest analytical sensitivity in head-to-head comparison was measured for the Mikrogen\_new IgG assay. Taking the serum working dilutions of each assay into account, the Wantai IgG assay was the most sensitive assay. Receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis showed area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.943, 0.964, 0.969, 0.971, 0.974 and 0.994 for the DSI, Mikrogen\_old, MP Diagnostics, Mikrogen\_new, Wantai and DiaPro anti-HEV IgM assays, respectively. The highest specificity of currently available assays was found for the IgM Wantai assay ({\textgreater}99\%). If anti-HEV IgM and IgG results from each supplier were combined, DSI and Wantai assays were able to detect the highest number of (passed) HEV infections.

HEV genotypes 1 and 2 are endemic to various developing countries causing epidemics of acute viral hepatitis with human to human transmission. On the other hand, HEV genotypes 3 and 4 prevalent in developed countries commonly lead to subclinical infection and are transmitted zoonotically. HEV infection typically causes acute self-limiting illness associated with low morbidity and mortality. Infection with HEV genotype 1 or 2 in pregnancy, especially in the third trimester may lead to severe illness and fulminant liver failure. Poor maternal and fetal outcomes have been reported. Areas covered: This review highlights the various aspects of HEV infection in pregnancy including diagnosis, management, and prevention. Expert commentary: Treatment is mainly supportive with diligent monitoring and intensive care. Therapeutic termination of pregnancy cannot be recommended based to the available literature. Early liver transplantation (LT) should be considered in these patients although the indications and timing of LT are still controversial. Prevention of HEV infection or illness by improved sanitation and active/passive immunization needs further research.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis E is a form of acute hepatitis, which is caused by infection with hepatitis E virus. The infection is transmitted primarily through fecal-oral route and the disease is highly endemic in several developing countries with opportunities for contamination of drinking water. In these areas with high endemicity, it occurs as outbreaks and as sporadic cases of acute hepatitis. The illness often resembles that associated with other hepatotropic viruses and is usually self-limiting; in some cases, the disease progresses to acute liver failure. The infection is particularly severe in pregnant women. Patients with chronic liver disease and superimposed HEV infection can present with severe liver injury, the so-called acute-on-chronic liver failure. In recent years, occasional sporadic cases with locally acquired hepatitis E have been reported from several developed countries in Europe, United States, and Asia. In these areas, in addition to acute hepatitis similar to that seen in highly endemic areas, chronic hepatitis E has been reported among immunosuppressed persons, in particular solid organ transplant recipients. HEV-infected mothers can transmit the infection to foetus, leading to premature birth, increased fetal loss and hypoglycaemia, hypothermia, and anicteric or icteric acute hepatitis in the newborns. Occasional cases with atypical non-hepatic manifestations, such as acute pancreatitis, hematological abnormalities, autoimmune phenomena, and neurological syndromes have been reported from both hyperendemic and non-endemic regions.

	abstract = {{\textbar} Hepatitis E, caused by infection with hepatitis E virus (HEV), is a common cause of enterically-transmitted acute hepatitis in developing countries. Occasional cases of sporadic hepatitis E have been increasingly recognized in developed countries over the past decade. These cases differ from those in developing countries in being possibly caused by zoonotic transmission, often affecting people with a suppressed immune system and occasionally leading to persistent HEV infection. The commonly used tests for HEV infection include detection of IgM and IgG anti-HEV antibodies and detection of HEV RNA. IgM anti-HEV antibodies can be detected during the first few months after HEV infection, whereas IgG anti-HEV antibodies represent either recent or remote exposure. The presence of HEV RNA indicates current infection, whether acute or chronic. Although several diagnostic assays for anti-HEV antibodies are available, they have undergone fairly limited testing and often provide discordant results, particularly for IgG antibodies. Thus, although the available antibody assays might be useful for case diagnosis in areas with high disease endemicity, their use for case diagnosis in areas with low endemicity and for seroprevalence studies remains problematic. Improved validation of existing anti-HEV antibody assays or development of new assays with superior performance characteristics is urgently needed.},

HEV RNA-positive patients were followed up by HEV testing, clinical symptoms, and transfusion history. Factors associated with anti-HEV were explored by multivariable logistic regression analysis. Samples from 1226 blood donors were retrospectively tested for anti-HEV IgG. Results: HEV RNA was detected in six patients (0.15\%) with no indications of chronic HEV infection. HEV RNA prevalence rates among recipients of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and solid organ transplantation (SOT) were 0.58\% and 0.21\%, respectively. Transfusion transmitted infections were refuted, and transfusion history was not associated with anti-HEV positivity. The difference in HEV seroprevalence between patients (22.0\%) and blood donors (10.9\%) decreased when adjusting for age and sex (odds ratio 1.20, 95\% confidence interval 0.97–1.48). Conclusions: HEV viremia among allo-HSCT and SOT recipients suggests that clinicians should be aware of this diagnosis. The lack of association of blood transfusion with anti-HEV positivity supports food-borne transmission as the main transmission route of HEV common to both patients and blood donors.},

	abstract = {Infection with the hepatitis E virus (HEV) is one of the most common causes, if not the most common, of acute hepatitis worldwide. In the last decade, we have learned that, in addition to the endemically and epidemically occurring form of hepatitis E, which is predominantly transmitted by contaminated drinking water and constitutes a significant health problem in resource-poor countries, there is a globally existing form of hepatitis E, which is a zoonosis and as such is primarily transmitted by the consumption of contaminated meat products. Although in most cases hepatitis E is subclinical or mild and self-limiting, pregnant women and patients with liver cirrhosis may have severe, occasionally even fatal disease, and immunocompromised individuals may develop chronic hepatitis E. Considering the substantial global health burden caused by HEV infection, it is surprising how limited our knowledge of hepatitis E pathology still is. In this article, we describe localization studies on HEV infection and discuss their implications for everyday diagnostics. Furthermore, we outline and discuss the spectrum of histologic changes, which can be found in HEV infection in various clinical contexts.},

	abstract = {Infection with hepatitis E virus (HEV) may be diagnosed by the presence of HEV RNA or anti-HEV antibodies. An enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was developed for the detection of antigen. Twenty-four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were produced. An indirect sandwich EIA was developed to detect HEV antigen using a combination of three mAbs as coating antibodies. Approximately 44.6\% (33/74), 28.6\% (50/175), and none (0/27) of sera positive for anti-HEV IgM alone, both anti-HEV IgM and IgG, and anti-HEV IgG alone also were positive for HEV antigen using this EIA. Forty-two HEV antibody-positive sera were tested for HEV RNA and antigen in parallel and the concordance was 81.0\% (34/42). All PCR products were found to belong to HEV genotype 4. In order to evaluate the temporal relationship between HEV antigen positivity and HEV RNA, anti-HEV IgG and IgM, and ALT concentrations, macaques were infected with HEV genotypes 1 and 4 and serial samples were collected. The results showed that the antigen EIA can detect the capsid proteins of both genotypes. HEV antigen was detectable prior to ALT elevation and the appearance of anti-HEV antibodies in the infected monkeys and lasted for several weeks in all cases. HEV antigen became detectable in the serum at almost the same time as HEV RNA in feces but persisted for 4 weeks less than HEV RNA. This assay should be valuable for the diagnosis of acute hepatitis E, particularly in the window period prior to seroconversion to anti-HEV. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {It was evaluated its antigenicity, immunogenicity and efficacy of a candidate recombinant hepatitis E virus (HEV) vaccine, referred hitherto as HEV 239 vaccine. The vaccine peptide has a 26 amino acids extension from the N terminal of another peptide, E2, of the HEV capsid protein, which has been shown to protect monkeys against HEV infection previously. The vaccine peptide is similar as E2 in that: first, the vaccine peptide migrates predominantly as dimer in SDS-PAGE and it is dissociated into monomers by heating; second, its dimeric form of which predominantly recognized by HEV reactive human serum; and third, it shows the same pattern of reaction as E2 with a panel of eight monoclonal antibodies that had been raised against E2. In contrast to E2, the vaccine peptide aggregates to form particles of 13 nm mean radius, and consequently, it is more than 240 times more immunogenic than E2. Using alum as adjuvant, immunizing dose determined in mice was 80-250 ng for the vaccine and {\textgreater}60 μg for E2. Rhesus monkeys twice vaccinated with a 10 μg or a 20 μg formulation of this vaccine showed essentially the same antibody response, whereas the response to a 5 μg formulation was delayed but reached similar antibody levels. All the three vaccine formulations afford complete protection against infection with 104 genome equivalent dose of the homologous genotype 1 virus. At higher virus dose of 107, the same vaccine formulation partially protected against the infection and completely protected against hepatitis. The efficacy of the vaccine was essentially the same for the homologous genotype 1 virus and heterologous genotype 4 virus. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Abstract: To generate a hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotype 3 (HEV-3)–specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), the Escherichia coli–expressed carboxy-terminal part of its capsid protein was used to immunise BALB/c mice. The immunisation resulted in the induction of HEV-specific antibodies of high titre. The mAb G117-AA4 of IgG1 isotype was obtained showing a strong reactivity with the homologous E. coli, but also yeast-expressed capsid protein of HEV-3. The mAb strongly cross-reacted with ratHEV capsid protein derivatives produced in both expression systems and weaker with an E. coli–expressed batHEV capsid protein fragment. In addition, the mAb reacted with capsid protein derivatives of genotypes HEV-2 and HEV-4 and common vole hepatitis E virus (cvHEV), produced by the cell-free synthesis in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) cell lysates. Western blot and line blot reactivity of the mAb with capsid protein derivatives of HEV-1 to HEV-4, cvHEV, ratHEV and batHEV suggested a linear epitope. Use of truncated derivatives of ratHEV capsid protein in ELISA, Western blot, and a Pepscan analysis allowed to map the epitope within a partially surface-exposed region with the amino acid sequence LYTSV. The mAb was also shown to bind to human patient–derived HEV-3 from infected cell culture and to hare HEV-3 and camel HEV-7 capsid proteins from transfected cells by immunofluorescence assay. The novel mAb may serve as a useful tool for further investigations on the pathogenesis of HEV infections and might be used for diagnostic purposes. Key points: • The antibody showed cross-reactivity with capsid proteins of different hepeviruses. • The linear epitope of the antibody was mapped in a partially surface-exposed region. • The antibody detected native HEV-3 antigen in infected mammalian cells.},

In this report, we examine the historical development and components of the Brazilian health system, focusing on the reform process during the past 40 years, including the creation of the Unified Health System. A defining characteristic of the contemporary health sector reform in Brazil is that it was driven by civil society rather than by governments, political parties, or international organisations. The advent of the Unified Health System increased access to health care for a substantial proportion of the Brazilian population, at a time when the system was becoming increasingly privatised. Much is still to be done if universal health care is to be achieved. Over the past 20 years, there have been other advances, including investments in human resources, science and technology, and primary care, and a substantial decentralisation process, widespread social participation, and growing public awareness of a right to health care. If the Brazilian health system is to overcome the challenges with which it is presently faced, strengthened political support is needed so that financing can be restructured and the roles of both the public and private sector can be redefined.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Infectious complications are often predictable and may be preventable. This article is an overview of practical considerations in the care of immunocompromised patients. Recognizing the compromised host, identifying and correcting risk factors in advance, and reducing sources of infection all play a role in prevention. Topics were chosen to include the areas of care that differ from the immune competent patient, such as diet, pet therapy, handwashing, immunizations, augmentation of host resistance, prevention of pneumonia, and antibiotic prophylaxis. National practice guidelines are cited when possible; evidence-based literature review and experience are applied to situations lacking consensus statements. Treatment decisions are made in areas for which information is often incomplete. A systematic approach to care of the immunocompromised host, tailored to the individual patient's needs, should reduce the risk of infection.},

	abstract = {Background \& Aims: We sought to identify and quantify the clinical factors that were associated with opportunistic infections in inflammatory bowel disease patients. Methods: We identified 100 consecutive IBD patients with opportunistic infections. For each case, 2 matched IBD patients who did not have a history of opportunistic infection were selected as controls. Conditional logistic regression was used to assess associations between putative risk factors and opportunistic infections, presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: In univariate analysis, use of corticosteroids (OR, 3.4; 95\% CI, 1.8–6.2), azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine (OR, 3.1; 95\% CI, 1.7–5.5), and infliximab (OR, 4.4; 95\% CI, 1.2–17.1) were associated individually with significantly increased odds for opportunistic infection. Multivariate analysis indicated that use of any one of these drugs yielded an OR of 2.9 (95\% CI, 1.5–5.3), whereas use of 2 or 3 of these drugs yielded an OR of 14.5 (95\% CI, 4.9–43) for opportunistic infection. The relative risk of opportunistic infection was greatest in IBD patients seen at older than 50 years of age (OR, 3.0; 95\% CI, 1.2–7.2, relative to those 24 years or younger). No patient died from opportunistic infection. Conclusions: Immunosuppressive medications, especially when used in combination, and older age are associated with increased risk of opportunistic infections. The absolute risk of opportunistic infection in IBD patients remains to be determined, as does any potential benefit of any preventive strategy.},

	abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are characterized by chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract associated with an imbalance of the intestinal microbiota. Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the most widely known types of IBD and have been the focus of attention due to their increasing incidence. Recent studies have pointed out genes associated with IBD susceptibility that, together with environment factors, may contribute to the outcome of the disease. In ulcerative colitis, there are several therapies available, depending on the stage of the disease. Aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and cyclosporine are used to treat mild, moderate, and severe disease, respectively. In Crohn’s disease, drug choices are dependent on both location and behavior of the disease. Nowadays, advances in treatments for IBD have included biological therapies, based mainly on monoclonal antibodies or fusion proteins, such as anti-TNF drugs. Notwithstanding the high cost involved, these biological therapies show a high index of remission, enabling a significant reduction in cases of surgery and hospitalization. Furthermore, migration inhibitors and new cytokine blockers are also a promising alternative for treating patients with IBD. In this review, an analysis of literature data on biological treatments for IBD is approached, with the main focus on therapies based on emerging recombinant biomolecules.},

Taking cognizance of heterogeneity and the “ratchet effect,” this paper adopts the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) framework as a starting point and re-estimates the relationship using different panel date models. The main results are obtained by dynamic panel threshold regression models, which divide a balanced panel dataset of 73 countries over the period of 1971–2010 into four groups according to their annual income levels. The key results are: (1) in the low-income group, urbanization decreases energy consumption but increases CO2 emissions; (2) in the middle-/low-income and high-income groups, industrialization decreases energy consumption but increases CO2 emissions, while urbanization significantly increases both energy consumption and CO2 emissions; (3) for the middle-/high-income group, urbanization does not significantly affect energy consumption, but does hinder the growth of emissions; while industrialization was found to have an insignificant impact on energy consumption and CO2 emissions; (4) from the population perspective, it produces positive effects on energy consumption, and also increases emissions except for the high-income group. These novel methodology and findings reveal that different development strategies of urbanization and industrialization should be pursued depending on the levels of income in a bid to conserve energy and reduce emissions.},

O objetivo deste estudo foi verificar a associação entre a prática de irrigação no território do Estado da Bahia e a ocorrência e a difusão da infecção pelo Schistosoma mansoni. O desenvolvimento da irrigação no Estado da Bahia assume duas formas: a primeira é intensiva em capital e mecanizada, voltada para produção agrícola de exportação e necessitando de pouca mão-de-obra. Na segunda forma, caracteriza-se pelo baixo grau de mecanização e utilização intensiva de mão-de-obra. O estudo mostrou que os municípios com as maiores áreas irrigadas não são aqueles que registram as mais altas taxas de prevalência da infecção. Na maior parte desses municípios a irrigação é intensiva em termos de capital e tecnologia. Os achados concluem que diferentemente do observado na África, no Estado da Bahia, a irrigação tem tido pequena influência na definição do perfil espacial da endemia.},

The data collected delimit the likely sources of\&nbsp;infection in the city. The identification of the S. mansoni outbreaks is fundamental to subsidize the actions of\&nbsp;surveillance and control of this neglected disease, but of great importance for public health.},

	abstract = {This report describes the development of a SYBR Green I based real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol for detection on the ABI Prism 7000 instrument. Primers targeting the gene encoding the SSU rRNA were designed to amplify with high specificity DNA from Schistosoma mansoni, in a real time quantitative PCR system. The limit of detection of parasite DNA for the system was 10 fg of purified genomic DNA, that means less than the equivalent to one parasite cell (genome {\textasciitilde}580 fg DNA). The efficiency was 0.99 and the correlation coefficient (R²) was 0.97. When different copy numbers of the target amplicon were used as standards, the assay could detect at least 10 copies of the specific target. The primers used were designed to amplify a 106 bp DNA fragment (Tm 83ºC). The assay was highly specific for S. mansoni, and did not recognize DNA from closely related non-schistosome trematodes. The real time PCR allowed for accurate quantification of S. mansoni DNA and no time-consuming post-PCR detection of amplification products by gel electrophoresis was required. The assay is potentially able to quantify S. mansoni DNA (and indirectly parasite burden) in a number of samples, such as snail tissue, serum and feces from patients, and cercaria infested water. Thus, these PCR protocols have potential to be used as tools for monitoring of schistosome transmission and quantitative diagnosis of human infection.},

	abstract = {Visando a contribuir para o aperfeiçoamento das estratégias de controle da esquistossomose mansônica, foram estudadas as modificações no padrão de distribuição das prevalências municipais no Estado da Bahia no período de 1950 a 1994, seus determinantes e o efeito da quimioterapia em larga escala. Verificou-se redução da prevalência média de esquistossomose para o estado como um todo, de 15,6\% para 9,5\%, no período de estudo. Não foram observadas modificações substanciais no padrão básico de distribuição espacial da prevalência. Entretanto, em municípios do oeste, sudoeste e litoral norte do estado, verificou-se aumento da prevalência, indicando o surgimento de novas áreas de transmissão. Comparando-se as variações das prevalências municipais de acordo com a utilização da quimioterapia em larga escala, verificou-se que houve redução na Bacia do Paraguaçu, onde vem sendo intensamente adotada tal medida, em proporção semelhante ao que foi observado para algumas áreas sem quimioterapia. As análises de correlação e regressão utilizadas não evidenciaram associação entre a quimioterapia e a variação da prevalência, observando-se correlações significativas entre esta última variável e a dinâmica populacional. Esses resultados indicam que a redução da prevalência de esquistossomose no estado não pode ser atribuída exclusivamente à utilização de quimioterapia, mas deve contemplar a articulação com os fatores relacionados à organização do espaço, que contribuem para diminuir o risco de transmissão. A forma incompleta e espacialmente desigual que caracteriza o processo de urbanização, aliada à intensa mobilidade da população, possibilita a disseminação da esquistossomose mansônica para novas áreas de transmissão, como evidenciado no Estado da Bahia.
          , 
            In order to aid the development of new approaches to schistosomiasis control, changes were analyzed in prevalence at the county level in the State of Bahia from the 1950s to the 1990s, as were determinants and the effect of community-based chemotherapy. In general, no substantial changes were observed in the basic pattern of spatial distribution of the prevalence of infection. However, during the period studied, there was an overall reduction in prevalence from 15.6\% to 9.5\% and an increase in prevalence rates in some counties from the western, southeastern, and northern areas of Bahia, indicative of new transmission areas. The effect of mass chemotherapy was analyzed. In the Paraguaçu Basin, where this control measure was used on a large scale, there was a reduction in prevalence similar to areas where this measure was not used. Correlation and regression analysis also failed to show links between mass chemotherapy and long term reduction in prevalence. The most powerful variables to explain these changes were those related with population dynamics. These findings strongly suggest that the reduction in prevalence observed in some areas of the State must be attributed to factors related with the spatial organization of this territory, causing a general decrease in the transmission rate, secondary to mass chemotherapy. At the same time, the incomplete form and the spatial unequalities that characterized the urbanization process created favorable conditions for the spread of schistosomiasis mansoni and the establishment of new foci.},

METHODS: Between July 2010 and September 2012 were performed: (1) malacological survey searching for breeding sites, collection and identiﬁcation of Biomphalaria snails positive for Schistosoma mansoni in Recife, PE, Northeastern Brazil; (2) prevalence survey in 2,718 schoolchildren aged from seven to 14 years old to identify cases of schistosomiasis, clinical examination and ultrasound in positive cases of S. mansoni. The autochthony of the cases was investigated and all of them were clinically evaluated. The cases and breeding sites were georeferenced and spatially described.
RESULTS: The results identiﬁed 30 breeding with B. straminea, four of which were potential foci of transmission, as molecular testing identiﬁed snails with S. mansoni DNA. There were 14 children diagnosed with schistosomiasis, of which ﬁve were considered to be autochthonous cases of the disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Urgent measures are required in order to avoid schistosomiasis becoming endemic to Recife, as has happened in other coastal areas of the state of Pernambuco.},

	abstract = {Doenças Tropicais Negligenciadas são um grupo de patologias que explicitam os investimentos seletivos e as desigualdades sociais. Dentre as mais prevalentes no Brasil, tem-se a Esquistossomose, doença infecto-parasitária, com alta incidência na região Nordeste. Assim, objetiva-se analisar os dados da esquistossomose na Bahia, de 2010 a 2019, e avaliar a influência de fatores externos na prevalência dessa doença. Realizou-se uma revisão sistematizada dos trabalhos publicados, de 2010 a 2020, em português, no PubMed com o descritor “Schistosomiasis OR Schistosomiasis mansoni AND Brazil AND Neglected Diseases”. Critérios de seleção: título e/ou resumos pertinentes ao tema, metodologia e pontuação superior a 17 itens na “Declaração STROBE”. Dos 89 resultados, 5 artigos foram selecionados. Ademais, foram coletados dados no DATASUS, IBGE, SINAN, Programa de Controle da Esquistossomose (PCE) e SIA/SUS. Verificou-se que a Bahia é o segundo Estado do Nordeste em casos de esquistossomose, 60,2\% dos seus municípios são classificados como endêmicos ou focais, dos quais somente 44,51\% possuem cobertura de saneamento básico. Analisando os locais endêmicos, o PCE demonstra que entre 2010 a 2019 ocorreram 45.581 casos, com um decréscimo a partir de 2014. Segundo o SINAN, ocorreram 5.137 casos de 2010 a 2017, em regiões não endêmicas, ratificando o artigo sobre a expansão da esquistossomose em áreas urbanas. Quanto aos gastos públicos, a morbidade hospitalar no SUS gerou um gasto médio de 330,88 reais por internação, totalizando, nesse período, 6.662,13 reais. A mortalidade por causa direta de Esquistossomose é de 8,26\%, porém os artigos analisados destacam o problema da subnotificação de morte indireta por essa doença. Portanto, evidencia-se a urgência no combate à esquistossomose e a negligência relacionada com a gestão inadequada dos recursos públicos nesse aspecto. Outrossim, apesar da redução do número de casos, o valor absoluto é elevado, e a subnotificação constitui-se um fator limitante para esta pesquisa.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify and quantify the socioeconomic determinants of schistosomiasis in the urban section of São Lourenço da Mata, a town in the Northeast of Brazil. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in 1988 to measure the prevalence of schistosomiasis in São Lourenço da Mata among individuals aged 10-25 years and to estimate the socioeconomic characteristics of the households of those individuals. Household aggregation was tested. The data were analyzed on two levels, the family level and the individual level. On the family level we estimated the odds ratios for the association of schistosomiasis and socioeconomic variables related either to the head of the family or to the household. On the individual level we investigated if for the infected individuals there were differences in the intensity of infection (mean egg count) for the different levels of the socioeconomic variables. RESULTS: We found a significant degree of household aggregation of schistosomiasis (allowing for sex and area of residence (neighborhoods with similar socioeconomic conditions, according to census data)). In the analysis on the family level, better socioeconomic indicators for the place in the productive process (occupation, economic sector, and position in production of the head of the family, plus family income) and better socioeconomic indicators for patterns of consumption (level of education of the head of the family, type of housing, household possessions, water supply for the home, sanitation (that is, excreta collection), and family access to medical care) were all associated with a lower risk of schistosomiasis. The estimation of the probability of schistosomiasis for different levels of the socioeconomic variables showed a lower risk (0.072) for individuals whose households were at the top (best) levels of the indicators relative to the risk (0.715) for individuals whose households were at the baseline (lowest) levels of the indicators. Infected individuals whose families had better socioeconomic conditions had lower mean egg count values. CONCLUSIONS: Control measures that may have a long-term effect, such as improvements in the water supply and sanitation, should be strongly encouraged. The theoretical reduction that we found in the probability of being infected if water supply and sanitation were improved highlights the importance of these measures. Implementing them would have a more permanent effect on the control of schistosomiasis and would also result in other benefits to the population.},

Os impactos causados à qualidade ambiental das águas dos rios urbanos impedem que os mesmos desempenhem suas funções ambientais, sociais, culturais e religiosas. As influências humanas na qualidade e no funcionamento adequado/natural dos sistemas hídricos, em prol do desenvolvimento urbano, despontam como as grandes responsáveis pelas condições atuais de suas águas. O objetivo principal deste trabalho foi avaliar o estado geral da qualidade das águas das Bacias Hidrográficas das cidades de Salvador e Lauro de Freitas, no estado da BA, a partir de duas abordagens complementares: o uso do Índice de Qualidade das Águas da National Sanitation Foundation e o Índice de Estado Trófico. Para a avaliação, foram selecionados ao menos três pontos em cada um dos principais rios de cada bacia, resultando num total de 47 pontos. Os pontos escolhidos estão dispostos da seguinte forma: um próximo à nascente, um próximo à foz e os demais, a meio curso. Esse delineamento permite realizar o acompanhamento da qualidade ao longo do rio. Os resultados do Índice da Qualidade da Água (IQA) e do Índice de Estado Trófico (IET) apresentaram cenários distintos para as Bacias Hidrográficas analisadas. Foi possível diagnosticar a perda progressiva da qualidade das águas da nascente para a foz em razão do aporte de efluentes domésticos oriundos das regiões mais densamente habitadas. Neste sentido, 70\% dos mananciais foram diagnosticados para a qualidade ambiental como Ruim ou Péssimo, de acordo com o IQA. Quanto ao IET, todos os pontos apresentaram algum nível de eutrofização, mesmo aqueles que apresentaram boa qualidade. A maior parte, quase 50\% dos trechos avaliados, apresentou eutrofização num estágio avançado (supereutrófico e/ou hipereutrófico), comprometendo assim seus usos múltiplos.},

	abstract = {To present the current epidemiological scenario of schistosomiasis related to urban transmission through an epidemiological risk assessment in Porto de Galinhas, a coastal area of Pernambuco, Brazil. Malacological and parasitological surveys were performed between the years 2018 and 2020. Snails were identified taxonomically and examined to confirm infection by Schistosoma mansoni, and so to identify Schistosomiasis Transmission Foci (STF) by the artificial light exposure technique. Stool samples were examined using the Kato-Katz method to identify schistosomiasis cases. Socioeconomic, environmental, behavioural and health data were collected by a questionnaire applied to participates in the survey and used to predict the schistosomiasis risk occurrence by multivariate logistic regression. In all, a total of 6466 snails of Biomphalaria glabrata were collected and 36 breeding sites were identified, of which 25 \% were STF. A total of 2236 individuals took part of the survey which identified 187 cases of schistosomiasis, registering a positivity percentage of 8.36 \%. The surveys identified the neighbourhoods with the highest risk for transmission while the socioenvironmental analysis identifies other risk factors for disease occurrence, such as gender, age range, level of education and absence of water drainage. We found that areas with poor sanitation, flooding during winter periods and dwellings located near mangroves should be treated by health authorities as priority areas for health interventions to minimize disease transmission. In addition, efforts to improve the population's educational level could certainly contribute to the adoption of measures to prevent and control this neglected tropical disease.},

Discovery of a focus of active transmission in the city of Salvador prompted a citywide survey for active and potential transmission sites. Cercariae shed from infected snails collected from four locations were used to determine how these samples were related and if they were representative of the parasite population infecting humans. Each cercarial collection was greatly differentiated from the others, and diversity was significantly lower when compared with eggs from natural human infections in one site. Egg samples collected 7 years apart in one neighborhood showed little differentiation (Jost's D = 0.01-0.03). Given the clonal nature of parasite reproduction in the snail host and the short-term acquisition of parasites, cercariae from collections at one time point are unlikely to be representative of the diversity in the human population.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis constitutes a major public health problem, and 200 million people are estimated to be infected with schistosomiasis worldwide. In Brazil, schistosomiasis has been reported in 19 states, showing areas of high and medium endemicity and a wide range of areas of low endemicity (ALE). Barra Mansa in Rio de Janeiro state has an estimated prevalence of 1\%. ALE represent a new challenge for the helminth control because about 75\% of infected individuals are asymptomatic and infections occur with a low parasite load ({\textless}100 eggs per gram of feces), causing a decrease in sensitivity of stool parasitological techniques, which are a reference for the laboratory diagnosis of this helminth. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a TaqMan quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) technique in serum and feces DNA samples using the techniques of Kato-Katz (KK), Hoffman, Pons and Janer (HH) as references, during an epidemiological survey using fecal samples and sera from randomized residents from an ALE.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study conducted from April to December 2011 using a probabilistic sampling that collected 572 fecal and serum samples. The laboratory diagnostic techniques used were: KK, HH and qPCR (feces and serum).
RESULTS: We obtained the following results using the different diagnostic techniques: KK and HH, 0.9\% (n =5); qPCR-feces, 9.6\% (n =55); and qPCR-serum, 1.4\% (n =8). The qPCR-feces presented the highest positivity, whereas the techniques of HH and KK were the least sensitive to detect infections (0.8\%). Compared to HH and KK, qPCR-feces showed a statistically significant difference in positivity (p {\textless}0.05), although with poor agreement.
CONCLUSION: The positivity rate presented by the qPCR approach was far higher than that obtained by parasitological techniques. The lack of adequate surveillance in ALE of schistosomiasis indicates a high possibility of these areas being actually of medium and high endemicity. This study presents a control perspective, pointing to the possibility of using combined laboratory tools in the diagnosis of schistosomiasis in ALE.},

	abstract = {The mansoni’s schistosomiasis (MS) is a serious and chronic parasitic disease, caused  
by trematode worms of the species Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni). Several  
factors (social and environmental) are associated with the high prevalence rates of MS  
in endemic areas. Data presented by the Schistosomiasis Control Program (SCP), in  
2014, revealed 27,525 positive tests for MS in northeastern Brazil. Of these, 9,775  
(35.51\%) were reported in the state of Alagoas, that is the second state in the country  
with the highest prevalence rate of this parasitosis. In addition, it has a deficiency in  
water supply and in the population's sewage system. Most municipalities in Alagoas  
have Human Development Index (HDI) below the national average and the illiteracy  
rate in the state is still high. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the spatial  
distribution and socioeconomic factors associated with MS cases in the municipalities  
of the Alagoas state, between 2007 and 2016. It is an epidemiological study, of the  
ecological type and time series, based on cases reported by the Information System  
of the Schistosomiasis Control Program (SISPCE). Socioeconomic factors were  
collected on the IBGE website and we used: HDI by Municipality (MHDI), Adequate  
Sanitation, Urbanization of public roads, Schooling Rate (SR) and Gross Domestic  
Product. The time trend was analyzed using the Joinpoint regression software. To  
assess the correlation between SCP data and socioeconomic variables, Spearman's  
correlation test (R) was applied and the association between variables was made  
through simple logistic regression. The spatial analysis maps were built using the QGIS  
and TerraView software. Alagoas state has 102 municipalities, of which 29 (28.43\%)  
were classified as a moderate prevalence of MS and five (4.9\%) as a high prevalence,  
most of them located mainly in the northwest region and coastal strip of the state. It  
was observed that positivity decreased in this period, from 8.11\% in 2007 to 4.96\% in  
2016 (Annual Percentage Change, APC = -5.71\%; p {\textless}0.05). However, there was also  
a reduction in the number of the population worked (APC = -2.84\%; p {\textless}0.05) and of  
examinations performed (APC = -5.05\%; p {\textless}0.05). There was a negative and  
significant correlation between infection by S. mansoni and MHDI (R = -0.34*) and TE  
(R = -0.24*). The main species of snail identified was Biomphalaria glabrata (94.79\%).  
However, B. straminea showed a higher percentage of positivity for S. mansoni 
(10.11\%). There was report of identification of B. tenagophila in Alagoas (n = 28; 0.5\%).  
The lack of data in the municipalities from backwoods of the state is due to the non coverage of these areas by the PCE and may, therefore, indicate underreporting of  
cases. Despite the reduction in the number of cases over this period, the  
epidemiological scenario of MS in Alagoas is still worrying and insidious, requiring  
emergency planning, investments and improvements in the programs of diagnosis,  
control and prevention of the disease.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method to detect Schistosoma mansoni DNA in stool samples from individuals living in a low-endemicity area in Brazil. Of the 125 initial stool samples, 80 were ELISA reactive and eggs were identified in 19 of the samples by parasitological examination. For the PCR evaluations, 56 stool samples were selected and divided into five groups. Groups I-IV were scored negative for S. mansoni eggs by parasitological examination. Groups I and II were ELISA reactive, whereas Groups III and IV were ELISA nonreactive. Groups II and III were positive for other intestinal parasites. PCR testing scored eight samples as positive from these four groups. Group V represented the S. mansoni -positive group and it included ELISA-reactive samples that were scored positive for S. mansoni by one or more parasitological examinations (6/19 were positive by Kato-Katz method, 9/17 by saline gradient and 10/13 by Helmintex®). PCR scored 13 of these 19 samples as positive for S. mansoni . We conclude that while none of these methods yielded 100\% sensitivity, a combination of techniques should be effective for improving the detection of S. mansoni infection in low-endemicity areas.},

	abstract = {Schistosomiasis is an infectious parasitic disease and one of the 20 diseases considered by the World Health Organization as a neglected tropical disease. It is typically associated with poor environmental and sanitary conditions, primarily affecting rural communities. However, with the currently observed rapid urbanization and predicted two-thirds of the world population living in urban areas by 2050, concerns are raised about a spread of schistosomiasis to urban and peri-urban areas. At the same time, there seems to be little knowledge of the extent of schistososomiasis in urban areas. In light of the efforts to control morbidity and ultimately achieve elimination of schistosomiasis as well as reaching Sustainable Development Goals 3 “achieve health for all” and 11 “make human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable,” this systematic literature review was conducted to address the existing research and mapping gaps and to contribute to the understanding of the burden of schistosomiasis in areas that have not, as yet, been the focus of control efforts and mass drug administration programs. The review suggests that rapid and unorganized urbanization and resulting poor living conditions in urban and peri-urban areas may lead to new disease foci and thereby increase the overall disease burden. Research and policy implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {In this interview, Green Illusions author Ozzie Zehner says that alternative energy technologies such as solar cells and wind turbines have become fetishes and spectacles that do nothing to offset coal use. Instead, he says, these technologies serve mostly as symbols that distract Americans and prevent them from considering cleaner and more affordable solutions to climate change and other environmental problems. He argues that subsidizing alternative energy technologies actually has a boomerang effect: By making energy cheaper for consumers, it increases the demand for energy. Zehner criticizes electric cars as inventions that are no better for the environment than gasoline-powered vehicles and that simply perpetuate a vehicle-centered culture. He describes how media coverage of energy-producing technologies such as solar cells and biofuels soars along with gas prices, while coverage of energy-saving technologies such as insulation stagnates. In Zehner’s view, Americans don’t have an energy crisis; they have a consumption crisis. He recommends that, instead of concentrating so much effort on developing alternative technologies, each of which comes with an unavoidable downside, environmentalists should focus on social and political programs—he cites youth cycling programs as one example—that are good for public health as well as the planet. Zehner suggests that such programs need to provide immediate personal benefits and long-term climate stabilization.},
